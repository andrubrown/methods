 Robert Lanza (1956- )During the twentieth and twenty-first centuries, Robert Paul Lanza studied embryonic stem cells, tissues,
	and endangered species as chief scientific officer of Advanced Cell
	Technology, Incorporated in Worcester, Massachusetts. Lanza's team cloned
	the endangered species of gaur Bos gaurus.
	Although the gaur did not survive long, Lanza successfully cloned
	another cow-like creature, called the banteng
	(Bos
	javanicus). Lanza also worked on cloning human embryos
	to harvest stem cells, which could be used to treat dieases. While
	previous techniques required the embryo's destruction, Lanza
	developed a harvesting technique that does not destroy the embryo,
	forestalling many ethical objections to human embryonic
	research.
Lanza was born on 11 February 1956. He experienced a childhood that he later said was typical of life in South Boston,
	Massachusetts. Lanza said that he was not close to his mother and that he
	struggled to connect with his father, a professional gambler. Lanza
	recounted exploring what wilderness there was to be found in
	suburban Boston or spending time in his tree house. Only two of four
	of his siblings completed secondary school.
In 1966, scientists explained the role of genes in forming proteins. Three years later, in 1969 and at the age of fourteen,
	Lanza conducted his first experiment involving genes. For a science fair, he altered the
	color of a chicken's white feathers to be partially black by
	attempting to induce melanin synthesis. Lanza recalled his motivation
	to work on the project because his teacher claimed that it was playing God. After completing the experiment, Lanza
	became frustrated by not having achieved a complete change in
	pigmentation. He found his way to Harvard Medical School in Boston,
	Massachusetts, looking to find any professor who would listen about
	his experiment. Lanza recounted arriving to closed gates, but after
	accosting someone he thought was a custodian, he found his way
	inside. The supposed custodian was actually Stephen Kuffler, a scientist who researched the brain
	and nervous system. Kuffler talked with the young Lanza
	and introduced him to Joshua Sanes, at that time a graduate student
	specializing on the nervous system. In 1974, with the help of
	Kuffler and Sanes, Lanza published his findings in
	Nature.
Lanza attended the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia,
	Pennsylvania, where he graduated in 1978 with an undergraduate
	degree in biology. As an undergraduate, Lanza worked in the lab of
	the 1972 Nobel Prize recipient Gerald Edelman at Rockefeller
	University in New York City, New York, in 1975. At that time, Lanza
	traveled to the University of Cape Town in Cape Town, South Africa,
	to learn from Christiaan Barnard, a surgeon who had performed the
	first human heart transplant.
After graduating in 1978, Lanza worked with disease researcher
	and polio vaccine creator Jonas Salk at the Salk Institute in San
	Diego, California. Lanza then spent the summer with psychologist
	Burrhus F. Skinner at Harvard University in Cambridge,
	Massachusetts. With Skinner, Lanza conducted experiments on pigeons
	demonstrating that they can communicate with one
	another.
Lanza stayed at The University of Pennsylvania for medical school, and he attended the University
	of Oxford in Oxford, United Kingdom, on a Fulbright fellowship.
	There, he worked with Edelman's Nobel Prize co-recipient, Rodney
	Porter, who studied antibodies and their structure. Lanza completed his medical degree in 1983. Then, Lanza took
	a two year break from research and later said that he went to Los
	Angeles to understand the universe.
After spending two years in Los Angeles, Lanza contacted and began to work with Patrick
	Soon-Shiong, a surgeon and medicinal researcher at the University of
	California in Los Angeles, California, working on
	insulin-free diabetic treatments. Soon-Shiong transplanted cells
	called islets, which produce insulin, into diabetic patients. Lanza
	observed that when foreign islets, such as animal or cadaver islets,
	were injected into a patient, rejection rates were high. Lanza
	recalled that, while working with Barnard in South Africa, he had
	observed that donor hearts were often rejected by the recipients,
	just as islets were being rejected in diabetic patients. Soon-Shiong
	and Lanza extracted islets from the surgically removed pancreas of a
	diabetic patient. These islets were accepted back by the patient's
	body after they were encapsulated by an immunological protectant
	made using algae.
Lanza returned in 1990 to Massachusetts, where chairman of
	BioHybrid Technologies, William Chick, convinced him to take a
	research position at the headquarters in Shrewsbury. Lanza continued
	to refine his encapsulation technique, when researchers at the
	Roslin Institute at the University of Edinburgh in Edinburgh,
	Scotland, cloned Dolly the sheep through nuclear transplantation in 1996. Lanza
	said he began to focus on embryonic stem cells, because cloned
	embryonic stem cells would not require encapsulation and would not
	be rejected by the intended host as frequently cells from other organisms. Lanza argued that,
	because cloned stem cells are genetically identical to the patient they are
	derived from, the body would not view them as a foreign threat.
	Chick, whose health had declined and who had suffered a series of
	strokes, rejected Lanza's arguments. In 1998, Chick died, and Lanza
	sought employment from a cloning company, Advanced Cell
	Technologies, Inc. (ACT), near the BioHybrid headquarters.
In 1999, Lanza joined ACT as its vice president of medical and
	scientific development. In 2001, Lanza cloned endangered animal, an
	Asian ox (the gaur or Bos gaurus) using somatic cell nuclear
	transfer. Lanza had removed the nucleus from a cow's egg ell, into
	which he transplanted a nucleus from a somatic cell from a gaur. The
	hybrid egg was then implanted in a surrogate cow and, after fetal
	development, the infant gaur was born, although it only lived for a
	few minutes. In 2003, ACT cloned another cow-like animal, the
	banteng (Bos javanicus), which into the early decades of the
	twenty first century, lived in the San Diego Zoo in San Diego,
	California.
ACT sought to research and clone human embryonic cells in addition to animal cells, but in 2001 the President of the United States, George
	W. Bush, blocked new federal funds for research into stem cells that
	used cells from embryos previously uncultured. Michael West, the
	ACT's chief executive officer, claimed that ACT researchers produced
	the first cloned human embryo soon after Bush's decision in late
	2001. West's claims were shown to be spurious, engendering public
	distrust towards ACT. Lanza continued to promote and represent ACT
	despite the fallout and the discontinuation of ACT's involvement in
	human embryonic research.
In 2003, along with new ACT colleagues Young Chung and Irina
	Klimanskaya, Lanza reinitiated human embryonic experiments after
	continued successes on animal cells. The team received approval from
	external ethics boards and, with money from ACT's animal research,
	they cloned a sixteen cell embryo.
Lanza and ACT struggled for funds because the government still
	would not fund stem cell research into new stem cell lines, so
	they relied on private funds. Lanza's new project was to use stem
	cells to counteract degenerative blindness. In 2010, Lanza and his
	team received 25 million dollars from investors and, in 2012, he
	attained federal approval to start clinical trials on therapies.
Lanza and synthetic biologist George Church, from Harvard Medical
	School in Boston, Massachusetts, established a new company. The company aimed to
	further research on induced pluripotent stem cells to address issues
	of reproduction for livestock and possibly to clone organisms from
	extinct species. Into the twenty-first century, Lanza, a bachelor, lived on a small island in the
	middle of a lake in Clinton, Massachusetts.
