 Green Fluorescent ProteinGreen fluorescent protein (GFP) is a protein in the
	jellyfish Aequorea
	Victoria that exhibits green fluorescence when exposed to
	light. The protein has 238 amino acids, three of them (Numbers 65 to 67)
	form a structure that emits visible green fluorescent light. In
	the jellyfish, GFP interacts with another protein, called aequorin,
	which emits blue light when added with calcium. Biologists use GFP
	to study cells in embryos and fetuses during developmental
	processes.
Biologists use GFP as a marker protein. GFP can attach to and
	mark another protein with fluorescence, enabling scientists to see
	the presence of the particular protein in an organic structure.
	Gfp refers to the gene that produces green fluorescent
	protein. Using DNA recombinant technology, scientists combine the
	Gfp gene to a another gene that produces a protein that they want to study,
	and then they insert the complex into a cell. If the cell produces
	the green fluorescence, scientists infer that the cell expresses the
	target gene as well. Moreover, scientists use GFP to label specific
	organelles, cells, tissues. As the Gfp gene is heritable, the
	descendants of labeled entities also exhibit green fluorescence.
Edmund N. Harvey, a professor at Princeton University in
	Princeton, New Jersey, initiated the studies on bioluminescence in
	the US. In 1921, Harvey described the yellow tissues in the umbrella
	of jellyfish as being luminous in particular conditions, such as at
	night or when the jellyfish is stimulated with electricity. In 1955,
	Demorest Davenport at the University of California at Santa Barbara
	in Santa Barbara, California, and Joseph Nicol at Plymouth Marine
	Laboratory in Plymouth, England, used photoelectric recording and
	histological methods to confirm Harvey's descriptions, and they
	identified the green fluorescent materials in the marginal canal of
	the umbrella.
In the same year, Osamu Shimomura became a research assistant at
	Nagoya University in Nagoya, Japan, and he crystallized the luciferin,
	a light-emitting compound found in the sea-firefly Vargula
	hilgendorfii. Shimomura published his results in 1957. One
	of Harvey's students, Frank H. Johnson, studied bioluminescence at
	Princeton University. Johnson followed Shimomura's work and invited
	him to work in the US, and in 1960 Shimomura received a
	Fulbright Travel Grant and started working with Johnson. Shortly
	after Shimomura arrived in the US, Johnson introduced the
	bioluminescence of Aequorea Victoria to Shimomura. In the US,
	jellyfish live only on the west coast, so Shimomura traveled to the
	Friday Harbor Laboratories of the University of Washington in San
	Juan Island, Washington, during the summer of 1961. After catching
	about 10,000 jellyfish, Shimomura took the extracts of the jellyfish
	and preserved it in dry-ice to bring it back to Princeton in
	September of 1961.
At Princeton, Shimomura and his colleagues started to purify the
	bioluminescent substance, and they found that it was a protein,
	which they called aequorin. When they purified aequorin, they also
	discovered traces of another protein, which showed green
	fluorescence. Shimomura's team published the findings in "Exraction,
	Purification, and Properties of Aequorin" in 1962. The paper was
	about aequorin, but it also described a green protein, which
	exhibited green fluorescence under sunlight. John W. Hasting and
	James G. Morin, who later researched  aequorin, termed the protein
	as green fluorescent protein in 1971.
Shimomura focused on aequorin, purified the protein, crystallized
	it, and elucidated its underlying structure. He also studied the
	properties of GFP, and published his last paper on GFP in 1979. In
	1981, after leaving Princeton University for the Marine Biology
	Laboratory in Woods Hole, Massachusetts, Shimomura did not research on GFP anymore. From 1979 to 1992, many researchers
	studied various aspects of GFP, including the use of Nuclear
	Magnetic Resonance to study the amino acids of the protein, the use
	of X-rays to study its crystal, and the evolution of GFP.
In the early 1990s, molecular biologist Douglas Prasher,
	at the Marine Biology Laboratory, used GFP to design probes, a
	technology involving fragments of DNA to detect the presence of
	nucleotide sequences. Prasher isolated the complementary DNA (cDNA)
	of Gfp gene, and he published the sequence of the gene in 1992.
	After the publication of the cDNA sequence in 1992, Prasher's funding from the
	American Cancer Society in Atlanta, Georgia, expired. When he applied
	for funding from the US National Institute of Health in Bethesda,
	Maryland, the reviewer argued that Prasher's research lacked
	contributions to society. As Prasher could not secure funding to
	support his research any further, he left the Marine Biology
	Laboratory to work for the US Department of Agriculture in
	Massachusetts.
After Prasher's publication in 1992, many scientists tried to
	transfer and express the Gfp gene in organisms other than
	jellyfish using DNA recombinant technology, and Martin Chalfie was
	the first who succeeded. Chalfie, a Professor at Columbia University
	in New York, New York, studied the development of the nematode Caenorhabditis
	elegans. Chalfie heard about the protein GFP in a lecture,
	and he speculated that GFP might facilitate his study of gene
	expression in C. elegans. Chalfie's team obtained the cDNA of
	the gene Gfp from Prasher and inserted only the coding
	sequence of Gfp gene first in the bacterium Escherichia
	Coli, and then in C. elegans. Chalfie and his team found
	that Gfp gene produced GFP without added enzymes or
	substrates in both organisms. In 1994, Chalfie published his results
	in "Green Fluorescent Protein as a Marker for Gene Expression". The
	detection of GFP needed only ultraviolet light. Thereafter, many
	biologists introduced GFP into their experiments to study gene
	expression. Satoshi Inouye and Frederick Tsuji at Princeton
	University also expressed Gfp in E. Coli in 1994.
Many scientists tried to mutate the Gfp gene to make the resultant protein
	react to wider wavelengths and emanate different colors. Other
	scientists studied different fluorescent proteins (FPs). Roger
	Tsien, a professor at the University of California San Diego, in San
	Diego, California, reengineered the gene Gfp to produce the
	protein in different structures. His team also reengineered other FPs.
	Due to Tsien's and other bioengineers' efforts, GFP could not only
	exhibit brighter fluorescence, but also respond to a wider range of
	wavelengths, as well as emit almost all colors, except for red.
	Tsien's findings enabled scientists to tag multiple colored GFPs to
	different proteins, cells, or organelles of interest, and scientists
	could study the interaction of those particles. Red FP became
	available in 1999, when Sergey Lukyanov's team at the
	Shemyakin-Ovchinnikov Institute of Bioorganic Chemistry in Moscow,
	Russia, found that some corals contained the red fluorescent
	protein, called DsRed. Other laboratories developed fluorescent
	sensors for calcium, protease and other biological molecules. Since
	then, scientists have reported more than 150 distinct GFP-like
	proteins in many species.
As GFP does not interfere with biological processes when used
	in vivo, biologists use it to study how organisms develop.
	For example, after 1994, Chalfie and his colleagues applied GFP in
	the study of the neuron development of C. elegans. In a 2002
	paper, Chalfie and his colleagues describe how they first labeled a
	specific gene involved in tactile perception in neuron cells with
	GFP, and then observed the amount of fluorescence emitted by those
	cells. Because mutant cells produced less or more GFP than normal
	cells, the abnormal amount of fluorescence production indicated the
	abnormal development of mutants. Since then, this field of research
	expanded to many other organisms, including fruitflies, mice, and
	zebra fish.
On 10 December 2008, The Royal Swedish Academy of Science academy
	awarded the Noble Prize in Chemistry to Tsien, Chalfie, and
	Shimomura for their discoveries on GFP.
