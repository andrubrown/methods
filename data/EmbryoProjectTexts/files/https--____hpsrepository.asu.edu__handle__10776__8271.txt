 Harry Hamilton Laughlin (1880-1943)Harry Hamilton Laughlin helped lead the eugenics
	movement in the United States during the early twentieth century.
	The US eugenics movement of the early twentieth century sought to
	reform the genetic composition of the United States population through
	sterilization and other restrictive reproductive measures. Laughlin
	worked as superintendent and assistant director of the Eugenics
	Research Office (ERO) at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory in Cold
	Spring Harbor, New York, alongside director Charles Davenport.
	During Laughlin's career at the ERO, Laughlin studied human familial
	ancestry, called pedigrees, and in 1922 published the book Eugenical
	Sterilization in the United States, which influenced
	sterilization laws in multiple states. Laughlin's support of
	compulsory sterilization to control the reproductive capacity of
	entire populations influenced the history of eugenics and
	reproductive medicine.
Laughlin was born on 11 March 1880, in Oskaloosa, Iowa, to
	Deborah Jane Ross Laughlin and George Hamilton Laughlin. He was the
	eighth of ten children. Laughlin's father lived in Quincy, Illinois,
	where he worked as a teacher and president of Oskaloosa College in
	Oskaloosa, Iowa. Laughlin's father also was a local minister
	for the Disciples of Christ. The Laughlin family later moved to
	Kirksville, Missouri, where Laughlin's father became an English
	professor at Kirksville State Normal School, which later became
	Truman State University in Kirksville, Missouri, and he was the
	minister of a local church from 1892 until his death in 1895.
Although Laughlin's four brothers became osteopathic doctors,
	Laughlin graduated in 1900 from Kirksville State Normal School with studies that focused on
	science education. He became the principal of a high school in
	Canterville, Iowa, and he married Pansy Bowen on 12 September 1902. The
	couple never had children. In 1905, Laughlin became school superintendent,
	but he left his post in 1907 to teach agriculture and nature studies at
	Kirksville State Normal School. In 1916, Laughlin received his
	master's degree in biology from Princeton University in Princeton,
	New Jersey, and his doctorate in 1917 for work on mitotic stages in
	the division of onion root-tip cells.
As a faculty member at Kirksville State Normal School, Laughlin
	contacted Charles Davenport, the director of the Station for
	Experimental Evolution at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory. Davenport
	studied genetic inheritance with Gregor Mendel's theory of
	heredity and genetics, and he worked to apply that theory to eugenics in the US. In 1910 he founded
	the Eugenics Record Office (ERO), which specialized in human
	pedigrees, at the Cold Springs Harbor Laboratory. Although
	Laughlin's doctoral thesis was on mitotic stages in the division of
	onion root-tip cells, his peers reported that he put in little
	experimental work. According to historians, Davenport noted
	this scarcity of experimental work, as Laughlin was said to
	strategically put together data to support his claims throughout his
	career. Laughlin studied agricultural breeding,
	thoroughbred race horses, and sex determination in date palms,
	but Davenport asked Laughlin to become superintendent of the ERO.
	Laughlin worked as superintendent from 1910 to 1921, and he was
	assistant director of the ERO under Davenport from 1921 to 1939.
Davenport and Laughlin worked together to establish the Eugenics
	Research Association at Cold Springs Harbor Laboratory in 1913,
	where Laughlin served as secretary-treasurer after 1917. They
	started to co-edit Eugenical News in 1916, which outlined
	current events in genetics. As supporters of public education in
	eugenics in the 1920s, the two kept in close contact with leading
	scientists in the US, such as Alexander G. Bell, David S. Jordan,
	Lothrop Stoddard, and Madison Grant. Laughlin was a member of the
	American Eugenics Society, an organization that encouraged American
	eugenics in the early twentieth century, from 1917 to 1939.
Although Laughlin suffered from epilepsy, his most prominent work
	focused on supporting widespread control of breeding in the
	populations he deemed inferior through immigration restrictions,
	physical sterilizations, and bans on interracial marriage
	(miscegenation). Those policies targeted people such as the
	physically handicapped, epileptics, mentally handicapped—then
	called feebleminded—alcoholics, blind persons, and foreigners.
In June 1920, Laughlin testified before the House Committee on
	Immigration and Naturalization in the United States Congress in
	Washington, D.C. He said that the extensive immigration from
	southern and eastern Europe between 1900 and 1920, primarily
	comprised of Italian and Jews, justified his attempt to survey all
	mental and charity institutions in the US. According to Laughlin, these immigrants
	diminished the genetic stature of the American people. After the
	testimony, committee chairman Albert Johnson appointed Laughlin to
	be the committee's Expert Eugenics Agent. The Immigration
	Restriction Act of 1924 soon followed, which restricted total
	immigration into the US to about twenty percent of previous
	levels. Evidence of Laughlin's views and values was displayed in the
	quota for southern and eastern European immigrants, which accounted
	for nine percent of total allotted immigration. The 1924 law restricted the number of people who could
	migrate from a country into the US to two percent of the
	population.
Laughlin published Eugenical Sterilization in the United States, published in
	1922. It featured Laughlin's
	 Model Eugenical Sterilization Law.
	Laughlin argued that the integration of inferior races of people in
	America was diminishing the quality of the American genotype. He said that the
	sterilization of such groups would not only lower taxes, by reducing
	the burden of caring for those he deemed defective, but it would
	also increase the safety of future generations. Laughlin said that
	parents inadvertently pass undesirable traits on to their children,
	creating new combinations of inferior traits in offspring. Laughlin
	supported eugenics as a biological science because it utilized
	biological  concepts such as phenotypic expression of genotypes and
	sex linkage. Even still, Laughlin admitted that heredity was not an
	exact science like mathematics or engineering.
Laughlin's arguments in Eugenical Sterilization in the United
	States influenced the passage of the Virginia Sterilization Act
	of 1924, which legalized the sterilization of the mentally disabled in
	Virginia. The 1927 US Supreme Court case decision of
	Buck v. Bell upheld the notion that compulsory sterilization
	did not violate the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment
	to the US Consitution. The Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth
	Amendment ensures that the government will not without due process deprive US citizens
	of life, liberty, and property. Before the Buck v. Bell case got
	to the US Supreme Court, Laughlin served at the trial court as an
	expert witness on behalf of the state of Virginia. By 1924, about
	three thousand people in the US had been sterilized due to statutes
	similar to the Virginia Sterilization Act of 1924.
Laughlin presented his work at the Third International Congress
	of Eugenics at the American Museum of Natural History in New York
	City, New York, in 1932. According to Laughlin, the pedigree was an
	exemplary model of what eugenics could produce if executed properly.
	To display how his research would better humankind or humanity,
	Laughlin discussed what he said were superior family characteristic of the
	Galton-Darwin-Wedgwood pedigree. Charles Darwin's son, Leonard
	Darwin, a colleague of Laughlin, supported Laughlin's project. The
	pedigree displayed the family tree of Darwin: the eighteenth century doctor Erasmus
	Darwin, grandfather of nineteenth century naturalist Charles Darwin,
	and Josiah Wedgwood, creator of the pottery company Josiah Wedgwood
	and Sons. The pedigree also delineated the lineage of Sir Francis
	Galton, cousin of Charles Darwin.
Laughlin's work was supported on an international scale. Adolf
	Hitler and the Nazi regime commended Laughlin on many accounts,
	primarily for his theory of excluding whole races from
	naturalization in general. The 1933 Sterilization Laws of Nazi Germany were
	sculpted after theories Laughlin had explicated in Eugenical
	Sterilization in the United States. The University of Heidelberg
	in Heidelberg, Germany, granted Laughlin an honorary master's degree
	in 1936 for his work. After his retirement from the ERO, Laughlin
	and his wife moved back to Kirksville where he died on 26 January
	1943 at the age of 62.
