 "Ethical Issues in Human Stem Cell Research: Executive Summary" (1999), by the US National Bioethics Advisory Commission "Ethical Issues in Human Stem Cell Research: Executive Summary" was published in September
	1999  by The US National Bioethics Advisory Commission in response to a national debate about
	whether or not the US federal government should fund embryonic stem cell research. "Ethical
	Issues in Human Stem Cell Research" recommended policy to US President William Clinton's
	administration, which advocated for federal spending on the use of stem research on stem cells
	that came from embryos left over from in vitro fertilization (IVF) fertility treatments.
	Although NBAC's proposals never became legislation, the report helped shape public, private, and
	international discourse on stem cell research policy.
 The National Bioethics Advisory Commission (NBAC) was initially created by President William
	Clinton on 3 October 1995 and was chaired by Harold T. Shapiro, former president of Princeton
	University and the University of Michigan. The committee aimed to deliberate on
	bioethical issues that arose from research on human biology and behavior, during a period of
	national debate surrounding stem cell research. The committee included members with backgrounds
	in law, medicine, philosophy, ethics, theology, and psychology. 
 As the NBAC compiled its report from November 1998 to September 1999, two US laws
	regulated federal funding of human embryonic stem cell research. First, the 1993 National
	Institutes of Health Revitalization Act gave the National Institute of Health (NIH) authority to
	fund human embryo research. Second, the 1995 Dickey-Wicker Amendment banned the use of federal
	funds for research that created embryos solely for research purposes or research in which human
	embryos are destroyed. Both of these policies helped cause debate in November 1998 after at
	least three publications described new possibilities of stem cell research and related ethical
	quandaries. Within one week, two independent research teams, James Thomson and colleagues at the
	University of Wisconsin, in Madison, Wisconsin, and John Gearhart and his colleagues at The
	Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, in Baltimore, Maryland, stated that they had
	isolated and cultivated human embryonic stem cells. Furthermore, the New York Times announced that the
	biotech company Advanced Cell Technology of Worcester, Massachusetts, developed a human-cow
	hybrid cell by removing the nucleus of the cow egg, and replacing it with the nucleus of a human
	cell. President Clinton called upon NBAC to evaluate the recently published research on stem
	cell derivation and somatic cell nuclear transfer. He gave the commission nine months to
	deliberate, consult experts, balance ethical claims, and formulate policy recommendations, which
	were ultimately presented in the report published in September 1999. 
"Ethical Issues in Human Stem Cell Research: Executive Summary" is organized into an
	introduction, thirteen recommendations, and a conclusion. In the introduction, NBAC
	distinguishes embryonic stem (ES) cells for other stem cells as capable of developing into nearly any cell
	type, whereas adult stem cells have more specific fates, such as renewing tissue in the lining
	of the gut, revitalizing skin cells and producing a range of blood cells. NBAC then describes
	the various methods with which researchers derive stem cells, and it lists applications of stem
	cells for treating disorders.
 The report distinguishes between two types of embryos. The first
	type includes embryos created solely for research purposes though IVF using somatic cell nuclear
	transfer, a process by which researchers remove the nucleus from a reproductive cell and then
	transfer the nucleus from a non-reproductive cell into the enucleated egg cell. The second type
	includes embryos that are initially created for infertility treatment using IVF. NBAC says that
	adult stem cells are not a legitimate alternative to ES cells because adult stem cells lack the
	potential to develop into as many cells as ES cells.
The second section of the executive summary presents NBAC's stance as to whether each
	category of ES cells should be federally funded. The commission asserts that the federal
	government should fund research using stem cells derived from embryos remaining after IFV
	infertility treatments. However, they argue that the federal government should not fund research
	using ESCs when the embryo is created for research purposes by either in vitro
fertilization or somatic cell nuclear transfer. These recommendations conflicted with the
	Dickey-Wicker Amendment, which since 1995 had banned funding that supported the derivation of ES cells. NBAC said that, as leftover embryos from IVF existed, there was no reason to fund
	scientists to create new embryos for research.
In the third section of the executive summary, NBAC advised private research organizations to
	employ consistent and ethical standards in its research. They recommended that any federally
	funded research proposals should be reviewed by the National Stem Cell Oversight and Review
	panel, to ensure that there is adequate justification for the use of the cell lines.
	This review panel would require that embryo donors give informed consent for their donation, and it
	would advocate that the US government create laws that prevent the buying or selling of embryos.
	In the executive summary, NBAC says that whether the federal government funds embryonic stem
	cell research or not, or if it decides to fund only certain types of research, privately funded
	research is exempt from the guidelines of federally funded research. The private sector could
	not be held to the same standards by the US government, as their funding was not federal.
	Instead, the private sector would have to voluntarily comply with the requirements that
	federally funded researchers are obligated to, but with no guarantee that they would do so. 
On 14 July 1999 the White House released a statement rejecting NBAC's preliminary
	recommendations. This was not the first time Clinton rejected the recommendations from his
	advisory commission. In 1994 Clinton had  banned the use of federal funds
	for embryos created for the sole purpose of research—a few hours after the National Insitutue of Health's Human Embryo Research
	Panel published their conclusions advising otherwise. 
In January 2000, President George Bush took office. July 2001, Shapiro, former chair of
	NBAC, wrote President Bush to offer NBAC's assistance and to notify him of NBAC's "Ethical
	Issues in Human Stem Cell Research" report. One month later in President George W. Bush's
	Announcement on Stem Cells, he revealed that the federal government would only fund embryonic
	stem cell research from already-existing stem cell lines, and it would not allow funding for the
	derivation of any new stem cells, regardless of NBACs recommendations. This law was federal policy
	until President Barack Obama lifted the ban by signing Executive Order 13505 on 9 March 2009,
	returning to legislation similar to the Clinton administration guidelines from August 2000. 
Since its publication, "Ethical Issues in Human Stem Cell Research" was cited by numerous
	scientific organizations in the US and internationally. In June 1999 UK's Chief Medical Officer,
	Liam Donaldson, established an Expert Group to give advice on what areas of embryonic stem cell
	research should receive funding. The group's report, "Stem cell research: Medical progress with
	responsibility," published a year later, cited NBAC's report as a comparative model. In 2000 the
	UK's Nuffield Council on Bioethics based their guidelines on restrictions proposed by NBAC
	regarding the buying and selling of human embryos. When the Canadian Institutes of Health
	Research deliberated about stem cell research from 1999 to 2000, they also reference NBAC's stem
	cell recommendations. During this same time, other countries such as Japan and Singapore
	studied the proceedings and conclusions of the US's National Bioethics Advisory Committee while
	formulating their own positions on various biomedical topics.
