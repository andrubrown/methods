 Bicoid is the protein product of a maternal-effect gene  unique to flies of the genus Drosophila . In 1988 Christiane Nüsslein-Volhard  identified bicoid as the first known morphogen . A morphogen is a molecule that determines the fate and phenotype of a group of cells through a concentration gradient across that developing region. The bicoid gradient, which extends across the anterior-posterior axis of Drosophila embryos, organizes the head and thorax.
