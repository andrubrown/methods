 George McDonald Church (1954- )George McDonald Church studied DNA from living and from
	extinct species in the US during the twentieth and twenty-first centuries. Church helped to develop and refine techniques with which to describe the complete sequence of all the DNA nucleotides in an organism's genome, techniques such as 
	multiplex sequencing, polony sequencing, and nanopore sequencing. Church also contributed to the Human Genome Project, and in 2005 he helped start a company, the Personal Genome Project. Church proposed to
	use DNA from extinct species to clone and breed new organisms from
	those species.
Church was born on 28 August 1954 to Virginia A. Strong and Henry
	S. McDonald III. His father was a lieutenant in the United States
	Air Force, and Church was born on MacDill Air Force Base near Tampa
	Bay, Florida. When Church was three-years-old, his parents allowed
	Peyton Jordan to adopt Church. In 1963, Church was again put up for
	adoption. This time, Gaylord Church adopted and raised Church.
	Despite completed high school at Phillips Academy in Andover,
	Massachusetts. He then completed
	undergraduate degrees in zoology and chemistry in 1974 at Duke
	University in Durham, North Carolina, in two years. He pursued 
	his doctoral degree in biochemistry from Duke, but he was expelled
	due to failing grades in 1976.
Church then applied to Harvard University in Cambridge, Massachusetts, and
	was accepted in 1977. In 1984, Church completed
	a PhD at Harvard in molecular biology while developing a direct
	genome sequencing technique as a part of his dissertation. At
	Harvard, Nobel Prize recipient
	Walter Gilbert advised his dissertation research. At that time, researchers described the sequence of nucleotides in strands of DNA, a process called sequencing, by
	using bacteria. They used the bacteria to replicate one strand of DNA into many strands with the same nucleotides, but the process lost genetic
	information. Researchers injected DNA into bacteria and allowed the
	bacterial cell to replicate the DNA, sometimes causing errors in
	replication. Church and Gilbert developed a technique that ameliorated some of those errors.
Church continued to develop new sequencing methods. In 1984,
	The Human Genome Project consulted Church about gene
	sequencing. In 1986, Church became an assistant professor at Harvard Medical School in Boston, Massacussetts. While at Harvard in 1988, Church developed the
	method of multiplex DNA sequencing. Multiplex sequencing takes
	strands of DNA and gives them chemical tags and then sends them
	through an automated DNA sequencing machine. The machine can
	sequence multiple strands of DNA simultaneously, due to the chemical tags
	that the researcher attached. Multiplex DNA sequencing enabled a
	greater volume of sequences to be decoded in a shorter amount of
	time, making the Human Genome Project feasible.
In the 1990s, Church assisted in the development of another
	sequencing technique, called nanopore sequencing. For this technique
	researchers measure the change in electrical current at a nanopore,
	which is one nanometer in diameter, as each successive nucleotide on
	a DNA strand passed through it. Each kind of nucleotide registers a different voltage.
	In 1998 Harvard promoted Church to full professor in the medical school.
Polony sequencing further enabled researchers to use machines to
	automate the process of DNA sequencing. In conjunction, Church
	developed a commercially available sequencing machine, the Polonator
	G.007, which made DNA sequencing about one hundred times less expensive
	than it had been. Polony sequencing led Church to establish in 2005 the
	Personal Genome Project, an open source, open access genome bank.
	Scientists used the information stored in such a bank to study
	genomic interactions with the environment, traits that the genes
	express, and to better describe and explain the links between genes
	and disease.
In 2012, Church published a book with Ed Regis about synthetic life and biology
	titled Regenesis: How Synthetic Biology Will Reinvent Nature and
	Ourselves. By 2014, Church and Robert Lanza, of Advanced Cell
	Technology, Inc., in Malborough, Massachusetts, had begun a
	project to resurrect from cloned DNA sequences the extinct passenger pigeon.
By 2015, Church had published greater than 400 scientific articles and dozens of patents. Church's work spawned twelve commercial enterprises
	using synthetic biology to produce, among other things, bio-fuels, synthetic
	photo-synthesizers, and pharmaceuticals.
