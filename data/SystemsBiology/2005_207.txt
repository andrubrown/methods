AB Systems biology is an emerging discipline focused on tackling the enormous intellectual and technical challenges associated with translating genome sequence into a comprehensive understanding of how organisms are built and run. Physiology and systems biology share the goal of understanding the integrated function of complex, multicomponent biological systems ranging from interacting proteins that carry out specific tasks to whole organisms. Despite this common ground, physiology as an academic discipline runs the real risk of fading into the background and being superseded organizationally and administratively by systems biology. My goal in this article is to discuss briefly the cornerstones of modern systems biology, specifically functional genomics, nonmammalian model organisms and computational biology, and to emphasize the need to embrace them as essential components of 21st-century physiology departments and research and teaching programs.
