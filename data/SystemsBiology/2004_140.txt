AB We have developed a universal eTag(TM) multiplex assay platfornn that can be uniquely applied to survey the molecule profiles of biologic systems in sub-global large-scale analyses. The effectiveness of eTag(TM) assays when applied to focused system biology studies in molecular oncology and predictive toxicology is herein described while reviewing the Current methods commonly used. The multi-analyte and multiparameter assay approach for parallel analysis will form the basis of an emerging paradigm of multiplexed molecular profiling for signaling pathway networks and various aspects of drug development processes.
