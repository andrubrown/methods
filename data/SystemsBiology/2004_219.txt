AB Programming language technology can contribute to the development and understanding of Systems Biology by providing formal calculi for specifying and analysing the dynamic behaviour of biological systems. Our focus is on BioAmbients, a variation of the ambient calculi developed for modelling mobility in computer systems. We present a static analysis for capturing the spatial structure of biological systems and we illustrate it on a few examples.
