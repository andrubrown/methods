AB The ErbB receptor tyrosine kinases evolved as key regulatory entities enabling the extracellular milieu to communicate with the intracellular machinery to bring forth the appropriate biological response in an ever-changing environment. Since its discovery, many aspects of the ErbB family have been deciphered; with emphasis on aberration of signaling in human diseases. However, only now, with the availability of the atomic coordinates of these receptors, can we construct a comprehensive model of the mechanisms underlying ligand-induced receptor dimerization and subsequent tyrosine kinase activation. Furthermore, the recent introduction of new high-throughput screening methodologies, combined with the materialization of a systems biology perspective, reveals an overwhelming network complexity, enabling robust signaling and evolvability. This knowledge is likely to impact our view of diseases as system perturbations and resistance to ErbB-targeted therapeutics as manifestations of robustness.
