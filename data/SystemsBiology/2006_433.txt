AB One of the challenges of modern biology is to understand how cells within a developing organism generate, integrate, and respond to dynamic informational cues. Based on over two decades of intensive research, many parts and subroutines of the responsible signal transduction networks have been identified and functionally characterized. From this work, it has become evident that a complicated interplay between signaling pathways, involving extensive feedback regulation and multiple levels of cross-talk, underlies even the "simplest" developmental decision. Thus a signaling pathway can no longer be thought of as a rigid linear process, but rather must be considered a dynamic, self-interacting, and self-adjusting network. The Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor tyrosine kinase signaling pathway provides a prime vantage point from which to explore emerging principles in developmental signal transduction.
