AB The genomic revolution has brought a new vitality into research on Plasmodium, its insect and vertebrate hosts. At the cellular level nowhere is the impact greater than in the analysis of protein expression and the 'assembly' of the supramolecular machines that together comprise the functional cell. The repetitive phases of invasion and replication that typify the malaria life cycle, together with the unique phase of sexual differentiation provide a powerful platform on which to investigate the 'molecular machines' that underpin parasite strategy and stage-specific functions. This approach is illustrated here in an analysis of the ookinete of Plasmodium berghei. Such analyses are useful only if conducted with a secure understanding of parasite biology. The importance of carefully searching the older literature to reach this understanding cannot be over-emphasised. When viewed together, the old and new data can give rapid and penetrating insights into what some might now term the 'Systems-Biology' of Plasmodium. (C) 2004 Australian Society for Parasitology Inc.
