AB In this paper we investigate how the inclusion of time delay alters the dynamical properties of the Jacob-Monod model, describing the control of the P-galactosidase synthesis by the lac repressor protein in E. coli. The consequences of a time delay on the dynamics of this system are analysed using Hopf's theorem and Lyapunov-Andronov's theory applied to the original mathematical model and to an approximated version.
