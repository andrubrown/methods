AB An important challenge facing researchers in drug development is how to translate multi-omic measurements into biological insights that will help advance drugs through the clinic. Computational biology strategies are a promising approach for systematically capturing the effect of a given drug on complex molecular networks and on human physiology. This article discusses a two-pronged strategy for inferring biological interactions from large-scale multi-omic measurements and accounting for known biology via mechanistic dynamical simulations of pathways, cells, and organ- and tissue level models. These approaches are already playing a role in driving drug development by providing a rational and systematic computational framework. (c) 2005 Federation of European Biochemical Societies.
