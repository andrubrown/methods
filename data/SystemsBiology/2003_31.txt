AB Systems biology is the iterative and integrative study of biological systems as systems in response to perturbations. It is founded on hypotheses formalized in models built from the results of global functional genomics analyses of the complexity of the genome, transcriptome, proteome, metabolome, etc. Its implementation by cross-disciplinary teams in a standardized mode under quality assurance should allow accessing the small variations of the large number of elements determining functioning of biological systems. Galactose utilization in yeast, and sea urchin development are two examples of emerging systems biology. (C) 2003 Academie des sciences. Published by Elsevier SAS. All rights reserved.
