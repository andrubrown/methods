AB Emerging systems biology aims at integrating the enormous amount of existing omics data in order to better understand their functional relationships at a whole systems level. These huge datasets can be obtained through advances in high-throughput, sensitive, precise, and accurate analytical instrumentation and technological innovation. Separation sciences play an important role in revealing biological processes at various omic levels. From the perspective of systems biology, CE is a strong candidate for high-throughput, sensitive data generation which is capable of tackling the challenges in acquiring qualitative and quantitative knowledge through a system-level study. This review focuses on the applicability of CE to systems-based analytical data at the genomic, transcriptomic, proteomic, and metabolomic levels.
