AB A surprisingly fewer than expected number of genes In the human genome suggests that sophistication of Its biologic system Is, In part, due to complex regulation of protein activities. The activities of most cellular proteins are regulated by post-translational modifications. One of the most Important post-translational modifications Is reversible protein phosphorylation, which decorates more than 30% of the proteome and regulates signal transduction pathways under normal conditions as well as In disorders such as diabetes, neurodegenerative diseases, autoimmune diseases and several forms of cancers. This review examines the recent developments In mass spectrometry-based methods for phosphoproteome analysis and its applications for the study of signal transduction pathways. The basic principles of non-mass spectrometry-based methods, such as chemical genetics and flow cytometry-based approaches, are also discussed as well as their specific advantages to signaling studies. Finally, signaling pathways are discussed in the light of large-scale protein interaction studies. The proteomic methods addressed in this review are emerging as some of the essential components in systems biology, which seeks to describe signaling networks through Integration of diverse types of data and, in the future, to allow computational simulations of complex biologic pathways in health and disease.
