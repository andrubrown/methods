AB Nuclear reprogramming resets differentiated tissue to generate induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells. While genomic attributes underlying reacquisition of the embryonic-like state have been delineated, less is known regarding the metabolic dynamics underscoring induction of pluripotency. Metabolomic profiling of fibroblasts vs. iPS cells demonstrated nuclear reprogramming-associated induction of glycolysis, realized through augmented utilization of glucose and accumulation of lactate. Real-time assessment unmasked downregulated mitochondrial reserve capacity and ATP turnover correlating with pluripotent induction. Reduction in oxygen consumption and acceleration of extracellular acidification rates represent high-throughput markers of the transition from oxidative to glycolytic metabolism, characterizing stemness acquisition. The bioenergetic transition was supported by proteome remodeling, whereby 441 proteins were altered between fibroblasts and derived iPS cells. Systems analysis revealed overrepresented canonical pathways and interactome-associated biological processes predicting differential metabolic behavior in response to reprogramming stimuli, including upregulation of glycolysis, purine, arginine, proline, ribonucleoside and ribonucleotide metabolism, and biopolymer and macromolecular catabolism, with concomitant downregulation of oxidative phosphorylation, phosphate metabolism regulation, and precursor biosynthesis processes, prioritizing the impact of energy metabolism within the hierarchy of nuclear reprogramming. Thus, metabolome and metaboproteome remodeling is integral for induction of pluripotency, expanding on the genetic and epigenetic requirements for cell fate manipulation.
