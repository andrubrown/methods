AB Metabonomics is rapidly evolving through advances in analytical technologies together with the development of new hyphenated approaches that are increasingly being applied to analyze complex biological systems. Improvements in analytical performance, such as increased sensitivity and selectivity, are providing greater resolution to analytical datasets and the rich potential of metabonomics as a systems biology tool of choice is becoming clear. However, such improvements are resulting in datasets becoming increasingly demanding in terms of data handling and interpretation, and the degree to which metabonomics continues to develop will be dependent on how chemometrics and data-handling approaches keep pace with continually improving analytical technologies. This review provides an overview of the field of metabonomics, with a particular focus on the analytical techniques that are chiefly employed and the chemometric methods that have found most use. However, in addition, we mention less widely used analytical methods and suggest that advanced statistical methods will play a larger role in the future.
