AB Objective: Re-construction of a genetic regulatory network from a given time-series gene expression data is an important research topic in systems biology. One of the main difficulties in building a genetic regulatory network lies in the fact that practical data set has a huge number of genes vs. a small number of sampling time points. In this paper, we propose a new linear regression model that may overcome this difficulty for uncovering the regulatory relationship in a genetic network.
