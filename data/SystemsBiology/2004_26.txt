AB Novel effects of naturally occurring peptides are continuing to be discovered, and their mechanisms of action,; as well as interactions with other substances, organs, and systems have been elucidated. Synthetic analogs may have actions similar or antagonistic to the endogenous peptides, and both the native peptides and analogs have potential as drugs or drug targets. The journal Peptides publishes many leading articles on the structure-activity relationship of peptides as well as outstanding reviews on some families of peptides. Complementary to the reviews. here we extract information from the original papers published during the past five years in Peprides (1999-2003) to summarize the effects of different classes of peptides, their modulation by other chemicals and various pathophysiological states, and the mechanisms by, which the effects are exerted. Special attention is given to peptides related to feeding, pain, and other behaviors. By presenting! in condensed form the effects of peptides which are essential for systems biology, we hope that this summary of existing knowledge will encourage additional novel research to be presented in Peptides.
