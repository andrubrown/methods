AB In this paper, we discuss data sets that are being generated by microarray technology, which makes it possible to measure in parallel the activity or expression of thousands of genes simultaneously. We discuss the basics of the technology, horn to preprocess the data, curd how classical and newly developed algorithms corn be used to generate insight in the biological processes that hark generated the data. Algorithms ire discuss are Principal Component Analysis, clustering techniques such as hierarchical clustering and Adaptive Quality Based Clustering and statistical sampling methods, such as Monte Carlo Markov Chains and Gibbs sampling. We illustrate these algorithms With several real-life cases from diagnostics and class discovery in leukemia, functional genomics research on the mitotic cell cycle of yeast, and motif detection in Arabidopsis thaliana using DNA background models. We also discuss some bioinformatics software platforms. In the final part of the manuscript, rye present some future perspectives on the development of bioinformatics, including some visionary discussions on technology, algorithms, systems biology and computational biomedicine.
