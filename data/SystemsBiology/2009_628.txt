AB Genetic regulatory networks (GRNs) are complex, large-scale, and spatially and temporally distributed. These characteristics impose challenging demands on software tools for building GRN models, and so there is a need for custom tools. In this paper, we report on our ongoing development of BioTapestry, an open Source, freely available computational tool designed specifically for building GRN models. We also outline our future development plans, and give some examples Of Current applications of BioTapestry. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.
