AB Reconstruction of protein interaction networks that represent groups of proteins contributing to the same cellular function is a key step towards quantitative studies of signal transduction pathways. Here we present a noel approach to reconstruct a highly correelated protein interaction network and to identify previously unknown components of a signaling pathway through integration of protein-protein interction data, gene expression data, and Gene Ontology annotations. A novel algorithm is designed to reconstruct a highly correlated protein interaction network which is composed of the candidate protein for signal transduction mechanisms in yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The high efficiency of the reconstruction process is proved by a Receiver Operating Characteristic curve analysis. Identification and scoring of the possible linear pathways enables reconstruction of specific sub-networks for glucose-induction signaling and high osmolarity MAPK signaling in S. cervisiae. All of the known components of these pathways are identified together with several new "candidate" proteins, indicating the successful reconstructions of two model pathways involved in S. cerevisiae. The integrated approach is hence shown useful for (i) prediction of new signaling pathways, (ii) identification of unknown members of documented pathways, and (iii) identification of network modules consisting of a group of related components that often incorporate the same functional mechanism.
