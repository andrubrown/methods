AB Developmental origins of cerebrovascular disease should synchronize neuroscience advances with classic neurodevelopmental principles, as discussed in part 1 of this review. The ontogenetic interplay of nature and nurture influencing cerebrovascular development during the prenatal and early postnatal time periods should be considered when designing neuroprotective strategies, as discussed in part 2. Appreciation of adaptive and maladaptive effects of developmental neuroplasticity requires a systems biology approach that integrates molecular, receptor, cellular, neural network, and behavioral perspectives into structural and functional cerebrovascular phenotypes that express health or disease. Cognizance of the interrelationships among maternal, placental, fetal, and neonatal factors requires an interdisciplinary appreciation of genetic/epigenetic forces affecting neuroplasticity during early life, with later life effects. Knowledge of the multi-organ influences on cerebrovascular development broadens the systems biology perspective. Studies of positive and negative effects of neuroplasticity during early life must then consider ongoing gene-environment interactions during childhood and adulthood that either sustain neurologic health or contribute to disease.
