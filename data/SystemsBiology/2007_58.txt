AB In this paper, we discuss the potential for the use of engineering methods that were originally developed for the design of embedded computer systems, to analyse biological cell systems. For embedded systems as well as for biological cell systems, design is a feature that defines their identity. The assembly of different components in designs of both systems can vary widely. In contrast to the biology domain, the computer engineering domain has the opportunity to quickly evaluate design options and consequences of its systems by methods for computer aided design and in particular design space exploration. We argue that there are enough concrete similarities between the two systems to assume that the engineering methodology from the computer systems domain, and in particular that related to embedded systems, can be applied to the domain of cellular systems. This will help to understand the myriad of different design options cellular systems have. First we compare computer systems with cellular systems. Then, we discuss exactly what features of engineering methods could aid researchers with the analysis of cellular systems, and what benefits could be gained. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.
