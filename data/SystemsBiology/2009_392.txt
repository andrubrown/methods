AB Background. Postshock mesenteric lymph (PSML) is the mechanistic link between. splanchnic ischemia reperfusion (IR) and remote organ injury. We hypothesize that an unbiased inspection of the proteome of PSML will reveal previously unrecognized aberrations in systems biology provoked by hemorrhage-induced mesenteric IR injury in vivo.
