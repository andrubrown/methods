AB We survey aspects of directional sensing. i.e. how a cell interprets differences in the external concentration of a chemoattractant to guide its motion, from the perspective of systems biology. We focus on questions that need to be addressed using a combination of modelling and experimental approaches. After briefly summarising the ideas underlying recent modelling efforts, we discuss a variety of experimental questions which are motivated by these models. Some ofthese questions focus on basic features of the chemotactic response, without involving much biochemistry, while others focus on filling some of the gaps inthe biochemistry, which have been brought to light by the models. The emphasis is on systematic quantitative experiments that will unambiguously resolve many of these issues. Finally, we describe some Current challenges for theoretical modelling and survey some of the theoretical tools and approaches employed to model the chemotaxis pathways.
