AB There is general agreement that a systems approach is needed for a better understanding of causal and functional relationships that generate the dynamics of biological networks and pathways. These observations have been the basis for efforts to get the engineering and physical sciences involved in life sciences. The emergence of systems biology as a new area of research is evidence for these developments. Dynamic modelling and simulation of signal transcluction pathways is an important theme in systems biology and is getting growing attention from researchers with an interest in the analysis of dynamic systems. This paper introduces systems biology in terms of the analysis and modelling of signal transduction pathways. Focusing on mathematical representations of cellular dynamics, a number of emerging challenges and perspectives are discussed.
