AB Systems biology tries to reconstruct living systems beyond bioinformatics or statistical approaches where known databases are analysed. An advantage is the dynamic variation in the model for instance by the addition of the factor time, which enables the researcher to simulate complex processes related to psychiatric diseases (systems neurobiology). Dynamic models of a patients' individual pathophysiology may be constructed employing multimodal brain imaging data of current neurotransmission and brain activation. From the clinical point of view, individual models of pathophysiology are preconditions for a personalised pharmacotherapy and may be suitable to predict adverse events, course of the disease and outcome. This review discusses the potential role of systems neurobiology in schizophrenia and focuses on evidence for a dysfunction of the dopamine and glutamate system.
