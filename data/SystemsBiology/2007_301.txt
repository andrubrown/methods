AB Partitioning of carbon dominates intracellular fluxes in both photosynthetic and heterotrophic plant tissues, and has vast influence on both plant growth and development. Recently, much progress has been made in elucidating the structures of the biosynthetic and degradative pathways that link the major and minor pools of soluble carbohydrates to cellular polymers such as starch, heteroglycans and fructans. In most cases, the regulatory properties of these pathways have been elucidated and the enzymes involved have been investigated using reverse genetics approaches. Although many of the results from these approaches were merely confirmatory, several of them were highly unexpected. The challenge ahead is to achieve better understanding of metabolic regulation at the network level in order to develop more rational strategies for metabolic engineering.
