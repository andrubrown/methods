AB center dot Premise of the study: Characterization of phototropism and gravitropism has been through gene expression studies, assessment of curvature response, and protein expression experiments. To our knowledge, the current study is the first to determine how the metabolome, the complete set of small-molecule metabolites within a plant, is impacted during these tropisms. center dot Methods: We have determined the metabolic profile of plants during gravitropism and phototropism. Seedlings of Arabidopsis thaliana wild type (WT) and phyB mutant were exposed to unidirectional light (red or blue) or reoriented to induce a tropistic response, and small-molecule metabolites were assayed and quantified. A subset of the WT was analyzed using microarray experiments to obtain gene profiling data. center dot Key results: Analyses of the metabolomic data using principal component analysis showed a common profile in the WT during the different tropistic curvatures, but phyB mutants produced a distinctive profile for each tropism. Interestingly, the gravity treatment elicited the greatest changes in gene expression of the WT, followed by blue light, then by red light treatments. For all tropisms, we identified genes that were downregulated by a large magnitude in carbohydrate metabolism and secondary metabolism. These included ATCSLA15, CELLULOSE SYNTHASE-LIKE, and ATCHS/SHS/TT4, CHALCONE SYNTHASE. In addition, genes involved in amino acid biosynthesis were strongly upregulated, and these included THA1 (THREONINE ALDOLASE 1) and ASN1 (DARK INDUCIBLE asparagine synthase). center dot Conclusions: We have established the first metabolic profile of tropisms in conjunction with transcriptomic analyses. This approach has been useful in characterizing the similarities and differences in the molecular mechanisms involved with phototropism and gravitropism.
