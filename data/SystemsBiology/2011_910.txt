AB This paper investigates the controllability of Boolean networks with time-invariant delays in states. After a brief introduction on converting the logic dynamics to discrete time delay systems, the controllability via two kinds of controls is studied. One kind of control is generated by Boolean control networks, another kind of control is free Boolean sequences. In both cases, necessary and sufficient conditions of the controllability of Boolean control networks are proved. Finally, examples are given to illustrate the efficiency of the obtained results.
