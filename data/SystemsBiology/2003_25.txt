AB The genomic era brought with it the capacity to unlock complex interactions in organisms and biological systems. Currently, by exploiting genomic and associated protein information through in silico analyses, post-genomic research is developing rapidly. This field, which encompasses functional genomics, structural genomics, transcriptomics, pharmacogenomics, proteomics and metabolomics, allows for a systems-wide approach to biological studies. To date, bacterial post-genomic research has focused mainly on a few representative pathogenic species, leaving the vast majority of the microbial community relatively overlooked. Amongst the under-represented microorganisms are the cyanobacteria, which are important for their beneficial natural product production, bioremediation and energy applications. Here, we highlight the current status of cyanobacterial postgenomic research and assess the potential for future metabolic engineering and 'cell factory' or 'microbial cell' development.
