AB Recent advances in mass spectrometry allowed the charting of bacterial serine/threonine/tyrosine phosphoproteomes with unprecedented accuracy, including the acquisition of a large number of phosphorylation sites. Phosphorylated bacterial proteins are involved in some key housekeeping processes, and their phosphorylation is expected to play an important regulatory role. When coupled to stable isotope labeling by amino acids in cell culture (SILAC), high-resolution mass spectrometry allows the detection of changes in the occupancy of phosphorylation sites in response to various stimuli. This and similar approaches promise to lead bacterial phospho proteomics into the era of systems biology, where the entire phosphorylation-based regulatory networks will be charted, modelled, and ultimately engineered to obtain desired properties.
