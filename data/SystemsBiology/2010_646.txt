AB The focus of biomarker studies is shifting toward deciphering patterns of biomolecules as they provide a more comprehensive depiction of disease than individual biomarkers. Multiplexing technologies are crucial in deciphering such patterns, but it is essential that they are validated for reproducibility and precision to ensure accurate protein identification. Here the authors examine such properties in Cytokine Bead Array (CBA) and Luminex kits and compare concentration measurements to those obtained using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Luminex kits were found to be highly reproducible and reliable; however, CBA kits were not due to aberrant standards. Absolute cytokine concentrations were dependent on the detection kit, but correlations with ELISA were good for all technologies. (Journal of Biomolecular Screening 2010: 562-568)
