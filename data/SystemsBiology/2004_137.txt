AB The intracellular environment of a cell hosts a wide variety of enzymatic reactions, diffusion events, molecular binding, polymerization and metabolic channeling. To transform these biological events into a computational framework, distinct modeling strategies are required. While currently no tool is capable of capturing all these events, progress is being made to create an integrated environment for the modeling community. To address this niche requirement, Cellware has been developed to offer a multi-algorithmic environment for modeling and simulating both deterministic and stochastic events in the cell.
