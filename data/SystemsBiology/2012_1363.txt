AB Gene expression changes in brains of individuals with schizophrenia (SZ) have been hypothesized to reflect possible pathways related to pathophysiology and/or medication. Other factors having robust effects on gene expression profiling in brain and possibly influence the schizophrenia transcriptome such as age and pH are examined. Pathways of curated gene expression or gene correlation networks reported in SZ (white matter, apoptosis, neurogenesis, synaptic plasticity, glutamatergic and GABAergic neurotransmission, immune and stress-response, mitochondria!, and neurodevelopment) are not unique to SZ and have been associated with other psychiatric disorders. Suggestions going forward to improve the next decade of profiling: consider multiple brain regions that are carefully dissected, release large datasets from multiple brain regions in controls to better understand neurocircuitry, integrate genetics and gene expression, measure expression variants on genome wide level, peripheral biomarker studies, and analyze the transcriptome across a developmental series of brains. Gene expression, while an important feature of the genomic landscape, requires further systems biology to advance from control brains to a more precise definition of the schizophrenia interactome.
