AB In this article, we propose to reflect on the meaning of complexity in relation to current biology, and in particular, in relation to current systems biological developments by considering them as confronting biology with the idea of a complex part whole determination of living systems, that is contextual as well as stratified. We attempt to trace as clearly as possible the abstract core of the idea of parts and wholes that is at stake in this contextual determination. In doing so, we have found inspiration in Kant's view on living systems. We argue that Kant's transcendental viewpoint can be relevantly actualized and extrapolated as a relational account of living systems, and will explore its ramifications starting from a multilevel view of living systems.
