AB The circadian system in higher organisms temporally orchestrates rhythmic changes in a vast number of genes and gene products in different organs. Complex interactions between these components, both within and among cells, ultimately lead to rhythmic behavior and physiology. Identifying the plethora of circadian targets and mapping their interactions with one another is therefore essential to comprehend the molecular mechanisms of circadian regulation. The emergence of new technology for unbiased identification of biomolecules and for mapping interactions at the genome-wide scale is offering powerful tools to decipher the regulatory networks underpinning circadian rhythms. In this review, the authors discuss the potential application of these genome-wide approaches in the study of circadian rhythms.
