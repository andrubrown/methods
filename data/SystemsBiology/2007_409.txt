AB We present the SBaddon package as an extension to the Systems Biology Toolbox for MATLAB (SBtoolbox). The goal of this extension is to provide the users of the SBtoolbox with important functionality that is needed for parameter estimation applications. While simulation in the SBtoolbox relies on the MATLAB ODE solvers, the SBaddon package provides considerably increased simulation performance through automatic generation of compiled simulation functions. Furthermore, the package contains improved optimization algorithms, forward parameter sensitivity analysis and basic numeric parameter identifiability analysis.
