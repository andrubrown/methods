AB Metabolism is usually treated as a set of chemical reactions catalysed by separate enzymes. However, various complications, such as transport of molecules across membranes, physical association of different enzymes, giving the possibility of metabolite channelling, need to be taken into account. More generally, a proper understanding of the nature of life will require metabolism to be treated as a complete system, and not just as a collection of components. Certain properties of metabolic systems, such as feedback inhibition of the first committed step of a pathway, make sense only if one takes a broader view of a pathway than is usual in textbooks, so that one can appreciate ideas such as regulation of biosynthesis according to demand. More generally still, consideration of metabolism as a whole puts the emphasis on certain systemic aspects that are crucial but which can pass unnoticed if attention is always focussed on details. For example, a living organism, unlike any machine known or conceivable at present, makes and maintains itself and all of its components. Any serious investigation of how this can be possible implies an infinite regress in which each set of enzymes needed for the metabolic activity of the organism implies the existence of another set of enzymes to maintain them, which, in turn, implies another set, and so on indefinitely. Avoiding this implication of infinite regress represents a major challenge for future investigation. (C) 2004 Elsevier SAS. All rights reserved..
