AB (A) review of the standards needs of the mitochondrial proteomics communities is presented based on the presentations and discussions at National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) workshop, Systems Biology Approaches to Health Care: Mitochondrial Proteomics, held on September 17-18, 2002. The mitochondrial proteomics areas addressed for standards needs are model systems, methods and data. This review outlines the challenges in the field, proposes standards efforts that the community would like to see pursued to meet those challenges, and is followed by a summary and NIST's planned efforts to address these standards requirements.
