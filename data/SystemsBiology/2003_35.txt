AB Microbial biodegradation of environmental pollutants is a field of growing importance because of its potential use in bioremediation and biocatalysis. We have studied the characteristics of the global biodegradation network that is brought about by all the known chemical reactions that are implicated in this process, regardless of their microbial hosts. This combination produces an efficient and integrated suprametabolism, with properties similar to those that define metabolic networks in single organisms. The characteristics of this network support an evolutionary scenario in which the reactions evolved outwards from the central metabolism. The properties of the global biodegradation network have implications for predicting the fate of current and future environmental pollutants.
