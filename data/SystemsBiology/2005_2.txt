AB Recent improvements in high-throughput proteomic technologies have unleashed the potential for generating vast amounts of data. Managing and sharing proteomic data is not an easy task. In this article, we will discuss some of the high-throughput proteomic techniques that are commonly used today. We will also review the major issues in sharing and dissemination of proteomic data and the recent community initiatives to standardize data formats and ontologies. An overview of the web-based resources and databases for analysis of proteomic data is also provided. Integration of disparate proteomic data sources with genomic and transcriptomic data should make systems biology type of approaches feasible in the near future. Published by Elsevier B.V.
