AB Enormous progress has been made in the selection of animals, including cattle, for specific traits using traditional quantitative genetics approaches. Nevertheless, considerable variation in phenotypes remains unexplained, and therefore represents potential additional gain for animal production. In addition, the paradigm shift in new disciplines now being applied to animal breeding represents a powerful opportunity to prise open the 'black box' underlying the response to selection and fully understand the genetic architecture controlling the traits of interest. A move away from traditional approaches of animal breeding toward systems approaches using integrative analysis of data from the 'omic' disciplines represents a multitude of exciting opportunities for animal breeding going forward as well as providing alternatives for overcoming some of the limitations of traditional approaches such as the expressed phenotype being an imperfect predictor of the individual's true genetic merit, or the phenotype being only expressed in one gender or late in the lifetime of an animal. This review aims to discuss these opportunities from the perspective of their potential application and contribution to cattle breeding. Harnessing the potential of this paradigm shift also poses some new challenges for animal scientists - and they will also be discussed.
