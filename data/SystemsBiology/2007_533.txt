AB Magnaporthe oryzae is the most destructive fungal pathogen of rice worldwide and because of its amenability to classical and molecular genetic manipulation, availability of a genome sequence, and other resources it has emerged as a leading model system to study host-pathogen interactions. This chapter reviews recent progress toward elucidation of the molecular basis of infection-related morphogenesis, host penetration, invasive growth, and host-pathogen interactions. Related information on genome analysis and genomic studies of plant infection processes is summarized under specific topics where appropriate. Particular emphasis is placed on the role of MAP kinase and cAMP signal transduction pathways and unique features in the genome such as repetitive sequences and expanded gene families. Emerging developments in functional genome analysis through large-scale insertional mutagenesis and gene expression profiling are detailed. The chapter concludes with new prospects in the area of systems biology, such as protein expression profiling, and highlighting remaining crucial information needed to fully appreciate host-pathogen interactions.
