AB Organelle size is an important determinant of organelle function, and for this reason cells have evolved mechanisms to control and adjust organelle size in the face of intrinsic biological fluctuations. Size control systems have been found that employ a variety of distinct mechanisms, which fall into a small number of classes. Each class represents a design principle by which artificial size controllers could be developed for synthetic biology applications. (c) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.
