AB Metabolomics or the large-scale phytochemical analysis of plants is reviewed in relation to functional genomics and systems biology. A historical account of the introduction and evolution of metabolite profiling into today's modern comprehensive metabolomics approach is provided. Many of the technologies used in metabolomics, including optical spectroscopy, nuclear magnetic resonance, and mass spectrometry are surveyed. The critical role of bioinformatics and various methods of data visualization are summarized and the future role of metabolomics in plant science assessed. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd.
