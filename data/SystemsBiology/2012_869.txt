AB Accumulation of modified nucleotides is defective to various cellular processes, especially those involving DNA and RNA. To be viable, organisms possess a number of (deoxy)nucleotide phosphohydrolases, which hydrolyze these nucleotides removing them from the active NTP and dNTP pools. Deamination of purine bases can result in accumulation of such nucleotides as ITP, dITP, XTP and dXTP. E. coil RdgB has been characterised as a deoxyribonucleoside triphosphate pyrophosphohydrolase that can act on these nucleotides. S. cerevisiae homologue encoded by YJR069C was purified and its (d)NTPase activity was assayed using fifteen nucleotide substrates. ITP, dITP, and XTP were identified as major substrates and kinetic parameters measured. Inhibition by ATP, dATP and GTP were established. On the basis of experimental and published data, modelling and simulation of ITP, dITP, XTP and dXTP metabolism was performed. (d)ITP/(d)XTPase is a new example of enzyme with multiple substrate-specificity demonstrating that multispecificity is not a rare phenomenon [BMB reports 2012; 45(4): 259-264]
