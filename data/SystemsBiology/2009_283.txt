AB Aging is a highly complex, multifactorial process. We use the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae as a model to study the mechanisms of cellular aging in multicellular eukaryotes. To address the inherent complexity of aging from a systems perspective and to build an integrative model of aging process, we investigated the effect of calorie restriction (CR), a low-calorie dietary regimen, on the metabolic history of chronologically aging yeast. We examined how CR influences the age-related dynamics of changes in the intracellular levels of numerous proteins and metabolites, carbohydrate and lipid metabolism, interorganellar metabolic flow, concentration of reactive oxygen species, mitochondrial morphology, essential oxidation-reduction processes in mitochondria, mitochondrial proteome, cardiolipin in the inner mitochondrial membrane, frequency of mitochondrial DNA mutations, dynamics of mitochondrial nucleoid, susceptibility to mitochondria-controlled apoptosis, and stress resistance. Based on the comparison of the metabolic histories of long-lived CR yeast and short-lived non-CR yeast, we propose that yeast define their long-term viability by designing a diet-specific pattern of metabolism and organelle dynamics prior to reproductive maturation. Thus, our data suggest that longevity in chronologically aging yeast is programmed by the level of metabolic capacity and organelle organization they developed, in a diet-specific fashion, prior to entry into a non-proliferative state.
