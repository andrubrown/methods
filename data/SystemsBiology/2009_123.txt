AB Tumors are complex structures of malignant cells and stromal cells that function as an integrated system that promotes tumor progression. Immune cells and other stromal components serve vital cooperative functions that often support tumor growth and metastasis; stromal content and function are strongly associated with disease progression and clinical outcome in cancer patients. Cellular systems biology considers tissues and tumors, and the cells within them, as integrated and interactive networks that function in concert as a system. Assessment of tumors as a "system" within the system of a patient using the cellular systems biology approach has the potential to improve on the current diagnostic tools for breast cancer by creating high content profiles of an individual patient's tumor. The application of cellular systems biology (CSB (TM)) profiling to early drug discovery using cellular models of disease [ 1] and to drug development using the CellCiphr (TM) Cytotoxicity Profiling panels [2] can optimize the efficacy and decrease the potential toxicity of compounds taken into pre-clinical trials. However, it has become clear that patient sub-populations can respond differently to drug candidates in clinical trials due to patient variability. Therefore, cellular systems biology can also be a powerful approach to patient stratification for clinical trials and could become an important diagnostic tool.
