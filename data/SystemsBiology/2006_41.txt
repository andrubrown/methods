AB We present theoretical models and discuss the computational modelling of complex linear and rotary molecular motor systems. The computer modelling of the linear motor systems is based on spatially and temporally resolved Fokker-Planck equations. These describe the coupled dynamics of molecular motors that are bound to filaments and molecular motors that diffuse freely in the embedding medium. Our modelling of the rotary molecular motor systems is based on spatially and temporally resolved extended Navier-Stokes equations describing the mutual influence of motor rotation and fluid dynamics as well as spatial in homogeneities. Our models consider space dependent propagation and rotation of motors, a spatially inhomogeneous motor distribution and spatial fluctuations in molecular properties. The simulations reveal the importance of systems biology on a mesoscopic scale that determines the behaviour of complex bimotor systems: Depending on the initial molecular distribution, motor-environment coupling, and spatio-temporal disorder, a spatially well-ordered organization or a controlled motion may result.
