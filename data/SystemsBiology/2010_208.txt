AB Genome sequencing and systems biology revolutionized life sciences. Proteomics emerged as a fundamental technique of this novel research area. This review aims to summarize the contribution of Arabidopsis thaliana as a model organism for plants and the increasing impact of proteome research. Techniques for proteomics based on 2-DE and especially gel-free shotgun LC-MS/MS platforms have improved significantly during the last decades. Proteomics has proven to be complementary to other -omics techniques such as transcriptomics and metabolomics. Arabidopsis thaliana as one of the first model organisms worldwide, served in several of the most comprehensive studies for enhance genome annotation, profiling of organelles, tissues, cells or sub-cellular proteomes, as well as developmental processes and responses to biotic and abiotic stresses using differential relative and absolute quantitative strategies. Consequently, insights into plant proteome dynamics and cell functions are rapidly increasing. A proteomics-toolbox developed for systems biology research on Arabidopsis will be introduced.
