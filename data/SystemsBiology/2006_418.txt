AB The identification and relative quantification of proteins in closely related biological samples is the backbone for many investigations in systems biology and for the discovery of biomarkers. While two-dimensional gel-based methodologies are still widely used for comparative proteomic studies, the recent advent of gel-free methodologies may allow the analysis of a larger number of samples in an automated fashion. Most of the technologies presented in this review require a chemical modification of proteins before analysis, and rely on the relative intensities of mass spectrometry signals for protein quantification. In particular, two-dimensional mass spectrometric mapping methodologies provide a visual representation of mass spectrometric data, thus facilitating the identification of differences in relative protein abundance.
