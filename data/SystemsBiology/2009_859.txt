AB The concept of epistasis has since long been used to denote non-additive fitness effects of genetic changes and has played a central role in understanding the evolution of biological systems. Owing to an array of novel experimental methodologies, it has become possible to experimentally determine epistatic interactions as well as more elaborate genotype-fitness maps. These data have opened up the investigation of a host of long-standing questions in evolutionary biology, such as the ruggedness of fitness landscapes and the accessibility of mutational trajectories, the evolution of sex, and the origin of robustness and modularity. Here we review this recent and timely marriage between systems biology and evolutionary biology, which holds the promise to understand evolutionary dynamics in a more mechanistic and predictive manner.
