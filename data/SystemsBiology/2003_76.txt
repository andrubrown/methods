AB Systems Biology starts by defining the components of a biological system and collecting the relevant previous biochemical and genetic data on a global scale, using high throughput platforms, formulating an initial model of the system, systematically perturbing the components of the system, and analysing the results. By comparing the observed responses to those predicted by the model, it is then possible to iteratively refine the model so that its prediction fit best to the experimental observations. Finally, new experimental perturbations are conceived and tested in order to distinguish between the multiple competing hypotheses.
