AB In the developing embryo, instructive guidance from the ventral endoderm secures cardiac program induction within the anterolateral mesoderm. Endoderm-guided cardiogenesis, however, has yet to be resolved at the proteome level. Here, through cardiopoietic priming of the endoderm with the reprogramming cytokine tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF alpha), candidate effectors of embryonic stem cell cardiac differentiation were delineated by comparative proteomics. Differential two-dimensional gel electrophoretic mapping revealed that more than 75% of protein species increased > 1.5-fold in the TNF alpha-primed versus unprimed endodermal secretome. Protein spot identification by linear ion trap quadrupole (LTQ) tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) and validation by shotgun LTQ-Fourier transform MS/MS following multidimensional chromatography mapped 99 unique proteins from 153 spot assignments. A definitive set of 48 secretome proteins was deduced by iterative bioinformatic screening using algorithms for detection of canonical and noncanonical indices of secretion. Protein-protein interaction analysis, in conjunction with respective expression level changes, revealed a nonstochastic TNF alpha-centric secretome network with a scale-free hierarchical architecture. Cardiovascular development was the primary developmental function of the resolved TNF alpha-anchored network. Functional cooperativity of the derived cardioinductive network was validated through direct application of the TNF alpha-primed secretome on embryonic stem cells, potentiating cardiac commitment and sarcomerogenesis. Conversely, inhibition of primary network hubs negated the procardiogenic effects of TNF alpha priming. Thus, proteomic cartography establishes a systems biology framework for the endodermal secretome network guiding stem cell cardiopoiesis.
