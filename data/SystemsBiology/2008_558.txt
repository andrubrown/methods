AB Traditional options available for deconvolution of data from gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) experiments have mostly been confined to semi-automated methods, which cannot compete with high-throughput and rapid analysis in metabolomics. In the present study, data sets acquired using GC with time-of-flight MS (GC-TOF-MS) were processed using three different deconvolution software packages (LECO ChromaTOF, AMDIS and SpectralWorks AnalyzerPro).
