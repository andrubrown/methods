AB Using radiation hybrid genotyping data, 99% of all possible gene pairs across the mammalian genome were tested for interactions based on co-retention frequencies higher (attraction) or lower (repulsion) than chance. Gene interaction networks constructed from six independent data sets overlapped strongly. Combining the data sets resulted in a network of more than seven million interactions, almost all attractive. This network overlapped with protein-protein interaction networks on multiple measures and also confirmed the relationship between essentiality and centrality. In contrast to other biological networks, the radiation hybrid network did not show a scale-free distribution of connectivity but was Gaussian-like, suggesting a closer approach to saturation. The radiation hybrid (RH) network constitutes a platform for understanding the systems biology of the mammalian cell.
