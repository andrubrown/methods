AB Systems biology needs to show practical relevance to commercial biological challenges such as those of pharmaceutical development. The aim of this work is to design and validate some applications in anti-cancer therapeutic development. The test system was a group of novel cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitors synthesised by Cyclacel Ltd. The measured in vitro IC(50)s of each compound were used as input data to a proprietary cell cycle model developed by Physiomics plc.
