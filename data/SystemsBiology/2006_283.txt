AB Interest in proteomics as a tool for drug development and a myriad of other applications continues to expand at a rapid rate. Proteomic analyses have recently been conducted on tissues, biofluids, subcellular components and enzymatic pathways as well as various disease and toxicological states, in both animal models and man. In addition, several recent studies have attempted to integrate proteomics data with genomics and/or metabonomics data in a systems biology approach. The translation of proteomic technology and bioinformatics tools to clinical samples, such as in the areas of disease and toxicity biomarkers, represents one of the major opportunities and challenges facing this field. An ongoing challenge in proteomics continues to be the analysis of the serum proteome due to the vast number and complexity of proteins estimated to be present in this biofluid. Aside from the removal of the most abundant proteins, a number of interesting approaches have recently been suggested that may help reduce the overall complexity of serum analysis. In keeping with the increasing interest in applications of proteomics, the tools available for proteomic analyses continue to improve and expand. For example, enhanced tools (such as software and labeling procedures) continue to be developed for the analysis of 2D gels and protein quantification. In addition, activity-based probes are now being used to tag, enrich and isolate distinct sets of proteins based on enzymatic activity. One of the most active areas of development involves microarrays. Antibody-based microarrays have recently been released as commercial products while numerous additional capture agents (e.g. aptamers) and many additional types of microarrays are being explored.
