AB The inner medullary collecting duct (IMCD) is an important site of vasopressin-regulated water and urea transport. Here we have used protein mass spectrometry to investigate the proteome of the IMCD cell and how it is altered in response to long-term vasopressin administration in rats. IMCDs were isolated from inner medullas of rats, and IMCD proteins were identified by liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). We present a WWW-based "IMCD Proteome Database" containing all IMCD proteins identified in this study (n = 704) and prior MS-based identification studies (n = 301). We used the isotope-coded affinity tag (ICAT) technique to identify IMCD proteins that change in abundance in response to vasopressin. Vasopressin analog (dDAVP) or vehicle was infused subcutaneously in Brattleboro rats for 3 days, and IMCDs were isolated for proteomic analysis. dDAVP and control samples were labeled with different cleavable ICAT reagents (mass difference 9 amu) and mixed. This was followed by one-dimensional SDS-PAGE separation, in-gel trypsin digestion, biotin-avidin affinity purification, and LC-MS/MS identification and quantification. Responses to vasopressin for a total of 165 proteins were quantified. Quantification, based on semiquantitative immunoblotting of 16 proteins for which antibodies were available, showed a high degree of correlation with ICAT results. In addition to aquaporin-2 and gamma-epithelial Na channel (gamma-ENaC), five of the immunoblotted proteins were substantially altered in abundance in response to dDAVP, viz., syntaxin-7, Rap1, GAPDH, heat shock protein (HSP) 70, and cathepsin D. A 28-protein vasopressin signaling network was constructed using literature-based network analysis software focusing on the newly identified proteins, providing several new hypotheses for future studies.
