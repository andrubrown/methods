AB In the postgenome-sequencing era, several large projects have been running recently. Proteomics and other analysis or structural biology are the most active today. Since the late 1990s, metabolomics has been gaining importance in systems biology, as it provides real-world end points that complement and help in the interpretation of genomic and proteomic data. Comprehensive information about the level changes of numerous metabolites present in the analyzed samples is essential in metabolomic studies. Therefore, the applied analytical techniques must be suitable for the simultaneous analysis of a diverse range of low-molecular-mass endogenous metabolites such as nucleosides at various concentrations and in different matrices, in particular, in urine and serum. In the view of metabolomic study, this domain is obviously significant to understand specific humans' reactions and it can be perceived as a diagnostic and predictive tool in pathological reactions. Since the term "metabolom" has occurred in common scientific use, there have been many publications about possible ways of analysis of nucleosides as metabolites of either oxidative DNA damage or RNA's turnover that are used as the potential tumor markers. Besides, the availability of fast, reproducible and easy to apply analytical techniques that would allow the identification of a large number of metabolites is highly desirable since they may provide detailed information about the progression of a pathological process. This paper, which describes the most relevant electromigration techniques, covers the period starting from the review of Karl H. Schram (Mass Spectrom. Rev. 1998, 17, 131-251) up to the beginning of 2009.
