AB Systems biology aims at an understanding of the genotype-phenotype relations brought about by cellular networks. Mathematical models as formal representations are central for handling the associated complexity. Recently, model-based analysis of microorganisms has begun, for instance, to reveal functional modules in metabolic and transcriptional networks, to predict cellular behavior from genome-scale physicochemical constraints, and to suggest novel design principles for well-studied bacterial subsystems such as chemotaxis. Guided by common themes such as modularity, optimality and robustness, iterative model development promises further progress towards a system-level understanding.
