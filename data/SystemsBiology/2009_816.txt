AB Nutrigenetics and nutrigenomics are nascent areas that are evolving quickly and riding on the wave of "personalized medicine" that is providing opportunities in the discovery and development of nutraceutical compounds. The human genome sequence and sequences of model organisms provide the equivalent of comprehensive blueprints and parts lists that describe dynamic networks and the bases for understanding their responses to external and internal perturbations. Unfolding the interrelationships among genes, gene products, and dietary habits is fundamental for identifying individuals who will benefit most from, or be placed at risk by, intervention strategies. More accurate assessment of the inputs to human health and the consequences of those inputs measured as accurate transcriptomic, proteomic, and metabolomic analyses would bring personalized health/diet to practice far faster than would waiting fora predictive knowledge of genetic variation. It is widely recognized that systems and network biology has the potential to increase our understanding of how nutrition influences metabolic pathways and homeostasis, how this regulation is disturbed in a diet-related disease, and to what extent individual genotypes contribute to such diseases.
