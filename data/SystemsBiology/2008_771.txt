AB We established a protocol to construct complete recombinant genomes from their small contiguous DNA pieces and obtained the genomes of mouse mitochondrion and rice chloroplast using a B. subtilis genome (BGM) vector. This method allows the design of any recombinant genomes, valuable not only for fundamental research in systems biology and synthetic biology but also for various applications in the life sciences.
