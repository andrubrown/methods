AB The applicability and potential of using elevated temperatures and sub 2-mu m porous particles in chromatography for metabonomics/metabolomics was investigated using, for the first time, solvent temperatures higher than the boiling point of water (up to 180 degrees C) and thermal gradients to reduce the use of organic solvents. Ultra performance liquid chromatography, combined with mass spectrometry, was investigated for the global metabolite profiling of the plasma and urine of normal and Zucker (fa/fa) obese rats (a well established disease animal model). "Isobaric" high temperature chromatography, where the temperature and flow rate follow a gradient program, was developed and evaluated against a conventional organic solvent gradient. LC-MS data were first examined by established chromatographic criteria in order to evaluate the chromatographic performance and next were treated by special peak picking algorithms to allow the application of multivariate statistics. These studies showed that, for urine (but not plasma), chromatography at elevated temperatures provided better results than conventional reversed-phase LC with higher peak capacity and better peak asymmetry. From a systems biology point of view, better group clustering and separation was obtained with a larger number of variables of high importance when using high temperature-ultra performance liquid chromatography (HT-UPLC) compared to conventional solvent gradients.
