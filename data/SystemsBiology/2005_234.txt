AB Genome sequencing has revealed that signal transduction in bacteria makes use of a limited number of different devices, such as two-component systems, Luxl-LuxR quorum-sensing systems, phosphodiesterases, Ser-Thr (serine-threonine) kinases, OmpR-type regulators, and sigma factor-anti-sigma factor pathways. These systems use modular proteins with a large variety of input and output domains, yet strikingly conserved transmission domains. This conservation might lead to redundancy of output function, for example, via crosstalk (i.e. phosphoryl transfer from a non-cognate sensory kinase). The number of similar devices in a single cell, particularly of the two component type, might amount to several dozen, and most of these operate in parallel. This could bestow bacteria with cellular intelligence if the network of twocomponent systems in a single cell fulfils the requirements of a neural network. Testing these ideas poses a great challenge for prokaryotic systems biology.
