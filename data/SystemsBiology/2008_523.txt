AB Membrane systems (also called P systems) and Brane calculi have been recently introduced as formal models inspired by the structure and the functioning of living cells, but having in mind different goals. The aim of Membrane systems was the formal investigation of the computational nature and power of various features of the cell, while Brane calculi aims to define a model capable of a faithful and intuitive representation of various biological processes.
