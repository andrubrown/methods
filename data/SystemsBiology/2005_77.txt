AB Polyamines and histamine are biogenic amines with multiple biological roles. In spite of the evidence for the involvement of both polyamines and histamine metabolism impairment in several highly prevalent pathological conditions, multiple questions concerning the molecular processes behind these effects remain to be elucidated. More comprehensive and systemic studies integrating molecular biology, biophysical and bioinformatics tools could contribute to accelerate the advances in this research area. This review is designed to underscore the main questions to be answered in polyamine and histamine research and how these new systemic approaches could help to find these answers.
