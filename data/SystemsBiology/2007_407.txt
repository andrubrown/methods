AB The identification of mutations that cause familial Parkinson's disease (PD) provides a framework for studies into pathways that may be perturbed also in the far more common, non-familial form of the disorder. Following this hypothesis, we have examined the gene regulatory network that links alpha-synuclein and parkin pathways with dopamine metabolism in neuropathologically verified cases of sporadic PD. By means of an in silico approach using a database of eukaryotic molecular interactions and a whole genome transcriptome dataset validated by qRT-PCR and histological methods, we found parkin and functionally associated genes to be up-regulated in the lateral substantia nigra (SN). In contrast, alpha-synuclein and ubiquitin carboxyl-terminal hydrolase L1 (UCHL1) gene expression levels were significantly reduced in both the lateral and medial SN in PD. Gene expression for Septin 4, a member of the GTP-binding protein family involved in alpha-synuclein metabolism was elevated in the lateral parkinsonian SN. Additionally, catalase and mitogen-activated protein kinase 8 and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase family member 1 (PARP1) known to function in DNA repair and cell death induction, all members of the dopamine synthesis pathway, were up-regulated in the lateral SN. In contrast, two additional PD-linked genes, glucocerebrosidase and nuclear receptor subfamily 4, group A, member 2 (NR4A2) showed reduced expression. We show that in sporadic PD, parkin, alpha-synuclein and dopamine pathways are co-deregulated. Alpha-synuclein is a member of all three gene regulatory networks. Our analysis results support the view that alpha-synuclein has a central role in the familial as well as the non-familial form of the disease and provide steps towards a pathway definition of PD.
