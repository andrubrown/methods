AB Systems biology promises to impact significantly on the drug discovery process. One of its ultimate goals is to provide an understanding of the complete set of molecular mechanisms describing an organism. Although this goal is a long way off, many useful insights can already come from currently available information and technology. One of the biggest challenges in drug discovery today is the high attrition rate: many promising candidates prove ineffective or toxic owing to a poor understanding of the molecular mechanisms of biological systems they target. A "systems" approach can help identify pathways related to a disease and can suggest secondary effects of drugs that might cause these problems and thus ultimately improve the drug discovery pipeline.
