AB The flood of data acquired from the increasing number of publicly available genomes has led to new demands for bioinformatics software. With the growing amount of information resulting from high throughput experiments new questions arise that often focus on the comparison of genes, genomes, and their expression profiles. Inferring new knowledge by combining different kinds of "post-genomics" data obviously necessitates the development of new approaches that allow the integration of variable data sources into a flexible framework. In this paper, we describe our concept for the integration of heterogeneous data into a platform for systems biology. We have implemented a Bioinformatics Resource for the Integration of heterogeneous Data from Genomic Explorations (BRIDGE) and illustrate the usability of our approach as a platform for systems biology for two sample applications.
