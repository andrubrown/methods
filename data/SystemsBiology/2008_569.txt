AB Motivation: Gene expression analysis with microarrays has become one of the most widely used high-throughput methods for gathering genome-wide functional data. Emerging-omics fields such as proteomics and interactomics introduce new information sources. With the rise of systems biology, researchers need to concentrate on entire complex pathways that guide individual genes and related processes. Bioinformatics methods are needed to link the existing knowledge about pathways with the growing amounts of experimental data.
