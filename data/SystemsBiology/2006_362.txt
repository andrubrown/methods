AB Unlike traditional biological research that focuses on a small set of components, systems biology studies the complex interactions between a large number of genes, proteins and other elements of biological networks and systems. Host-pathogen systems biology examines the interactions between the components of two distinct organisms, either a microbial or viral pathogen and its animal host or two different microbial species in a community. With the availability of complete genomic sequences of various hosts and pathogens, together with breakthroughs in proteomics, metabolomics and other experimental areas, the investigation of host-pathogen systems on a multitude of levels of detail has come within reach.
