AB Background: With higher-throughput data acquisition and processing, increasing computational power, and advancing computer and mathematical techniques, modelling of clinical and biological data is advancing rapidly. Although exciting, the goal of recreating or surpassing in silico the clinical insight of the experienced clinician remains difficult. Advances toward this goal and a brief overview of various modelling and statistical techniques constitute the purpose of this review.
