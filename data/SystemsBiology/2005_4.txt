AB The analysis of molecular networks, such as transcriptional; metabolic and protein interaction networks, has progressed substantially because of the power of models from statistical physics. Increasingly, the data are becoming so detailed-though not always complete or correct-that the simple models are reaching the limits of their usefulness. Here, we will discuss how network information can be described and to some extent quantified. In particular statistics offers a range of tools, such as model selection, which have not yet been widely applied in the analysis of biological networks. We will also outline a number of present challenges posed by biological network data in systems biology, and the extent to which these can be addressed by new developments in statistics, physics and applied mathematics.
