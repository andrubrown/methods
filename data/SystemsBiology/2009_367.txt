AB Neuroblastoma (NB) is one of the most common solid tumors of childhood and displays a remarkable diversity in both biologic characteristics and clinical outcomes. Availability of high-throughput 'omics technologies and their subsequent application towards oncology has provided insight into the complex pathways of tumor formation and progression. Investigation of NB 'omics profiles may better define tumor behavior and provide targeted therapy with the goal of improving outcomes in patients with high-risk disease. Utilization of these technologies in NB has already led to advances in classification and risk stratification. The gradual emergence of NB-directed proteomics adds a layer of intricacy to the analysis of biologic organization but may ultimately provide a better comprehension of this complex disease. In this review, we cite specific examples of how NB-directed proteomics has provided information regarding novel biomarkers and possible therapeutic targets. We finish by examining the impact of high-throughput 'omics in the field of NB and speculate on how these emerging technologies may further be incorporated into the discipline.
