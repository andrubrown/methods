AB Systems analysis has historically been performed in many areas of biology, including ecology, developmental biology and immunology. More recently, the genomics revolution has catapulted molecular biology into the realm of systems biology. In unicellular organisms and well-defined cell lines of higher organisms, systems approaches are making definitive strides toward scientific understanding and biotechnological applications. We argue here that two distinct lines of inquiry in molecular biology have converged to form contemporary systems biology.
