AB Background: The cellular microenvironment plays an important role in the regulation of homoeostasis and is a source of potential biomarkers and drug targets. In a genome-wide analysis the extracellular proteins that bind to heparin (HBPs) have been shown to form highly modular and interconnected extracellular protein regulatory networks. Using a systems biology approach, we have investigated the role of HBP networks in the normal pancreas and pancreatic digestive diseases.
