AB As an important functional genomic tool, metabolomics has been illustrated in detail in recent years, especially in plant science. However, the microbial category also has the potential to benefit from integration of metabolomics into system frameworks. In this article, we first examine the concepts and brief history of metabolomics. Next, we summarize metabolomic research processes and analytical platforms in strain improvements. The application cases of metabolomics in microorganisms answer what the metabolomics can do in strain improvements. The position of metabolomics in this systems biology framework and the real cases of integrating metabolomics into a system framework to explore the microbial metabolic complexity are also illustrated in this paper.
