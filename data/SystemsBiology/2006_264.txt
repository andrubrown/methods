AB Systems biology has recently become an important research paradigm that is anticipated to decipher the metabolic, regulatory, and signaling networks of complex living organisms on the whole organism level. Thus, various research outputs are being generated, along with the development of many tools and resources for systems biology research. Accordingly, this review provides a comprehensive summary of the current resources and tools for systems biology research that will hopefully be helpful to researchers involved in this field. The resources are categorized into the following five groups: genome information and analysis, transcriptome and proteome databases, metabolic profiling and metabolic control analysis, metabolic and regulatory information, and software for computational systems biology. A summary table and some future perspectives are also provided.
