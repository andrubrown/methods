AB Leaf senescence is an active process that involves the increased expression of many hundreds of genes. Many putative transcription factors show enhanced transcription during leaf senescence in Arabidopsis and functional analysis of these should help to indicate their role in controlling gene expression during leaf senescence. In this paper, we describe the analysis of knockout insertion mutants in two different senescence-enhanced genes, one encodes a heat shock transcription factor and the other a zinc finger protein. Plants mutated in these genes show accelerated leaf senescence and reduced tolerance to drought stress, indicating that expression of these genes during senescence has a protective role to maintain viability during this essential developmental process. Analysis of gene expression changes in both mutants compared to the wild-type plants indicates an increased rate of senescence but does not show clearly the pathway that is dependent on these genes for expression. The complexities of signalling networks in plant stress and the plasticity of plant responses mean that the direct consequences of mutation are very difficult to define. The usefulness of this type of approach to address the burning question of how senescence is regulated is discussed, and an alternative approach aimed at a more global analysis of gene regulation using systems biology methods is described.
