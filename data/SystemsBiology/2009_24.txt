AB The Aconitum alkaloids aconitine, mesaconitine, and hypaconitine are the main toxic components in a commonly used traditional Chinese herbal medicine Fu Zi. To provide guidelines for the safe use of this medicine, metabolic changes in Wistar rats caused by these compounds were investigated by means of integrated analysis of two metabonomic approaches: (1)H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and gas chromatography/time-of-flight mass spectrometry (CC/TOF-MS). Rats were given a single dose of aconitine, mesaconitine, hypaconitine, or vehicle. The largest metabolic changes were observed 6 h after treatment. Every group receiving a dose had higher urine concentrations of glucose, acetate, dimethylglycine, succinate, and alanine and had lower concentrations of creatinine, citrate, 2-oxoglutarate, N-acetylated metabolites, and trimethylamine-N-oxide (TMAO) than did the control group. These results may reflect the perturbation of renal tubular function within the first 24 h after treatment. The results also revealed a larger perturbation of metabolic profiles in the aconitine group than in the mesaconitine and hypaconitine groups, illustrating how these alkaloids exhibit different toxicities. An analysis of plasma samples collected 7 days postdose showed that there were higher levels of lactate, alanine, and lipids along with lower levels of glucose, P-hydroxybutyrate, and creatine in the plasma of the aconitine and mesaconitine groups than there were in the control and hypaconitine groups. The GC/TOF-MS data from the plasma samples showed that the number of metabolites, with significant changes or with a tendency to change, in the aconitine and mesaconitine groups were dissimilar, suggesting a possible difference in the acute toxicity mechanisms of these alkaloids.
