AB The rapidly growing field of neuroproteomics has expanded to track global proteomic changes underlying various neurological conditions such as traumatic brain injury (TBI), stroke, and Alzheimer's disease. TBI remains a major health problem with approximately 2 million incidents occurring annually in the United States, yet no affective treatment is available despite several clinical trials. The absence of brain injury diagnostic biomarkers was identified as a significant road-block to therapeutic development for brain injury. Recently, the field of neuroproteomics has undertaken major advances in the area of neurotrauma research, where several candidate markers have been identified and are being evaluated for their efficacy as biological biomarkers in the field of TBI. One scope of this review is to evaluate the current status of TBI biomarker discovery using neuroproteomics techniques, and at what stage we are at in their clinical validation. In addition, we will discuss the need for strengthening the role of systems biology and its application to the field of neuroproteomics due to its integral role in establishing a comprehensive understanding of specific brain disorder and brain function in general. Finally, to achieve true clinical input of these neuroproteomic findings, these putative biomarkers should be validated using preclinical and clinical samples and linked to clinical diagnostic assays including ELISA or other high-throughput assays.
