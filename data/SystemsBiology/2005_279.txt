AB This article is inscribed in the general motivation of understanding the dynamics on biochemical networks including metabolic and genetic interactions. Our approach is continuous modeling by differential equations. We address the problem of the huge size of those systems. We present a mathematical tool for reducing the size of the model, master-slave synchronization, and fit it to the biochemical context. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.
