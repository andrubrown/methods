AB Twenty-five years after the discovery of HIV as the cause of AIDS there is still no effective vaccine and no cure for this disease. HIV susceptibility shows a substantial degree of individual heterogeneity, much of which can be conferred by host genetic variation. In an effort to discover host factors required for HIV replication, identify crucial pathogenic pathways, and reveal the full armament of host defenses, there has been a shift from candidate-gene studies to unbiased genome-wide genetic and functional studies. However, the number of securely identified host factors involved in HIV disease remains small, explaining only similar to 15-20% of the observed heterogeneity - most of which is attributable to human lymphocyte antigen (HLA) variants. Multidisciplinary approaches integrating genetic epidemiology to systems biology will be required to fully understand virus-host interactions to effectively combat HIV/AIDS.
