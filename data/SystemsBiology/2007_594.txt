AB Integration of biological data of various types and development of adapted bioinformatics tools represent critical objectives to enable research at the systems level. The European Network of Excellence ENFIN is engaged in developing both an adapted infrastructure to connect databases and platforms to enable the generation of new bioinformatics tools as well as the experimental validation of computational predictions. We will give an overview of the projects tackled within ENFIN and discuss the challenges associated with integration for systems biology.
