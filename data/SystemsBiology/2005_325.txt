AB The Systems Biology Markup Language (SBML) is an XML-based format for representing models of Systems Biology. BioSPI is a formal model to simulate biological systems, which is evolved from process calculi. Based on the previous research on modeling Systems Biology using process algebra, we propose a method to map SBML to BioSPI. The motivation of the work is to make full use of BioSPI to analyze biological systems described by SBML. In this paper, the mapping rules are presented and an example is given to show the simulation results.
