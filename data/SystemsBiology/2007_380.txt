AB Evidence is growing in favour of a relationship between cancer and chronic inflammation, and particularly of the role of a polyamine and histamine metabolic interplay involved in these physiopathological problems, which are indeed highly complex biological systems. Decodification of the complex inter- and intra-cellular signalling mechanisms that control these effects is not an easy task, which must be helped by systems biology technologies, including new tools for location and integration of database-stored information and predictive mathematical models, as well as functional genomics and other experimental molecular approaches necessary for hypothesis validation. We review the state of the art and present our latest efforts in this area, focused on the amine metabolism field.
