AB The 'systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS)' reflects a non-specific inflammatory reaction to various insults. In sepsis, defined as SIRS triggered by infection, a complex and overwhelming network of mediators contributes to the clinical syndrome. The host response in sepsis is characterized by unspecific physiologic criteria, which are unable to identify patients adequately who might benefit from either conventional anti-infective therapies or from novel therapies targeting specific mediators of sepsis. The early diagnosis of sepsis, the identification of the origin, adequate therapeutical management and the monitoring of the disease may help to overcome sepsis-associated mortality, which is unacceptably high and the third leading cause of death in Western Countries.
