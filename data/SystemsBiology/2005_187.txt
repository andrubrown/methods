AB In general biologists are not accustomed to formulating biological problems in the precise mathematical terms that are required to solve the problems analytically or numerically. Although many computational tools for systems biology have been developed recently, our observations indicate that many of these tools are powerful only in the hands of those who know a lot about how to use them. For most biologists, the tools have a protracted learning curve and unfriendly user interface that often diminish their likelihood of being used.
