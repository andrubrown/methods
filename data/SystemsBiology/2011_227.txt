AB Retinoic acid (RA) triggers physiological processes by activating heterodimeric transcription factors (TFs) comprising retinoic acid receptor (RAR alpha, beta, gamma) and retinoid X receptor (RXR alpha, beta, gamma). How a single signal induces highly complex temporally controlled networks that ultimately orchestrate physiological processes is unclear. Using an RA-inducible differentiation model, we defined the temporal changes in the genome-wide binding patterns of RAR gamma and RXR alpha and correlated them with transcription regulation. Unexpectedly, both receptors displayed a highly dynamic binding, with different RXR alpha heterodimers targeting identical loci. Comparison of RAR gamma and RXR alpha co-binding at RA-regulated genes identified putative RXR alpha-RAR gamma target genes that were validated with subtype-selective agonists. Gene-regulatory decisions during differentiation were inferred from TF-target gene information and temporal gene expression. This analysis revealed six distinct co-expression paths of which RXR alpha-RAR gamma is associated with transcription activation, while Sox2 and Egr1 were predicted to regulate repression. Finally, RXR alpha-RAR gamma regulatory networks were reconstructed through integration of functional co-citations. Our analysis provides a dynamic view of RA signalling during cell differentiation, reveals RAR heterodimer dynamics and promiscuity, and predicts decisions that diversify the RA signal into distinct gene-regulatory programs.
