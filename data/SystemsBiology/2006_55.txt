AB Gravity is a fundamental factor which affects all living organisms. Plant development is well adapted to gravity by directing roots downward and shoots upwards. For more than a century, plant biologists have been fascinated to describe the molecular mechanisms underlying the gravitropic response of plants. Important progress towards signal perception, transduction, and response has been made, but new tools are beginning to uncover the regulatory networks for gravitropic control. We summarise recent progress in study of gravitropism and discuss strategies to identify the molecular basis of the gravity response in Arabidopsis thaliana. This will put us on a road towards the molecular systems biology of the Arabidopsis gravitropic response.
