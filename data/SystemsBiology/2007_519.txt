AB The high incidence of toxicity of antiviral drugs is a common complication in the long-term use of antiviral drugs to treat chronic viral infections, including HIV. This review describes the use of computational models to explore antiviral toxicity, concentrating on three series of recent papers that have used a combination of experimental and computational techniques to address the issue of antiviral toxicity from different viewpoints. The limitations of these studies are discussed and likely directions for future research are suggested.
