AB Systems biology based on integrative computational analysis and high technology is in a position to construct networks, to study the interactions between molecular components and to develop models of cardiac function and anatomy. Clinical cardiology gets an integrated picture of parameters that are addressed to ventricular and vessel mechanics, cardiac metabolism and electrical activation. The achievement of clinical objectives is based on the interaction between modern technology and clinical phenotype. In this review the need for more sophisticated realization of the structure and function of the cardiovascular system is emphasized while the incorporation of the systems biology concept in predicting clinical phenotypes is a promising strategy that optimize diagnosis and treatment in cardiovascular disease.
