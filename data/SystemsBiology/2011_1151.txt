AB We report recent advances in the field of droplet-based microfluidics. Specifically, we highlight the unique features of such platforms for high-throughput experimentation; describe functional components that afford complex analytical processing and report on applications in synthesis, high-throughput screening, cell biology and synthetic and systems biology. Issues including the integration of high-information content detection methods, long term droplet stability and opportunities for large scale and intelligent biological experimentation are also discussed.
