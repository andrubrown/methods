AB Pathway information is vital for successful quantitative modeling of biological systems. The almost 170 online pathway databases vary widely in coverage and representation of biological processes, making their use extremely difficult. Future pathway information systems for querying, visualization and analysis must support standard exchange formats to successfully integrate data on a large scale. Such integrated systems will greatly facilitate the constructive cycle of computational model building and experimental verification that lies at the heart of systems biology.
