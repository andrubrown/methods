AB Motivation: In the post-genomic era, biologists interested in systems biology often need to import data from public databases and construct their own system-specific or subject-oriented databases to support their complex analysis and knowledge discovery. To facilitate the analysis and data processing, customized and centralized databases are often created by extracting and integrating heterogeneous data retrieved from public databases. A generalized methodology for accessing, extracting, transforming and integrating the heterogeneous data is needed.
