AB Background: Endothelial dysfunction precedes pathogenesis of vascular complications in diabetes. In recent years, the mechanisms of endothelial dysfunction were investigated to outline strategies for its treatment. However, the therapies for dysfunctional endothelium resulted in multiple clinical trial failures and remain elusive. There is a need for defining hyperglycemia-induced endothelial dysfunction with both generic and specific dysfunctional changes in endothelial cells (EC) using a systems approach. In this study, we investigated hyperglycemia-induced endothelial dysfunction in HUVEC and HMVEC. We investigated hyperglycemia-induced functional changes (superoxide (O-2(-)), and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) production and mitochondrial membrane polarization) and gene expression fingerprints of related enzymes (nitric oxide synthase, NAD(P) H oxidase, and reactive oxygen species (ROS) neutralizing enzymes) in both ECs.
