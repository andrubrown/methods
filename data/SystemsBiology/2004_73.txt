AB In the post-genomic era, the large-scale, systematic, and functional analysis of all cellular components using transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics, together with bioinformatics for the analysis of the massive amount of data generated by these "omics" methods are the focus of intensive research activities. As a consequence of these developments, systems biology, whose goal is to comprehend the organism as a complex system arising from interactions between its multiple elements, becomes a more tangible objective. Mathematical modeling of microorganisms and subsequent computer simulations are effective tools for systems biology, which will lead to a better understanding of the microbial cell and will have immense ramifications for biological, medical, environmental sciences, and the pharmaceutical industry.
