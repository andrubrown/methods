AB Introduction Marek's disease (MD), a herpesvirus-induced lymphoma of chickens is a unique natural model of CD30-overexpressing (CD30(hi)) lymphoma. We have previously proposed that the CD30(hi) neoplastically transformed CD4+ T cells in MD lymphomas have a phenotype antagonistic to cell mediated immunity. Here were test the hypothesis that the CD30(hi) neoplastically transformed MD lymphoma cells have a phenotype more closely resembling T-helper (Th)-2 or regulatory T (T-reg) cells.
