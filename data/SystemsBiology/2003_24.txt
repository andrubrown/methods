AB Mass spectrometry is already established as the method of choice for protein identification. Hitherto, a major limitation of mass spectrometry was the inability to quantitate protein levels. With the development of novel methods, such as the AQUA method by Gerber et al., this hurdle has finally been overcome, unleashing the power of mass spectrometry to study protein dynamics in cells.
