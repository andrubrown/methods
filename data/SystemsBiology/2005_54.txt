AB The reasons why the standards of evaluating Western medicine are not suitable for testing traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) are explicit in the therapeutic objective and principles of TCM. TCM aims to correct maladjustments and restore the self-regulatory ability of the body, and not to antagonize specific pathogenetic targets. Maladjustments in a disease can be classified into several 'patterns' according to TCM theory. Multiple diseases might share one 'pattern' and be treated by the same herbal formula whereas one disease might display several different 'patterns' and be treated by multiple formulae. These principles are supported by evidence that multi-system changes in one pattern can be modulated by a herbal formula. The approaches used in systems biology and pharmacogenetics are similar to the practices of TCM. I propose that a combined approach using specific parameters associated with modern medicine, the general condition of individuals, as outlined by TCM, and pattern stratification of diseases should be employed to re-evaluate herbal formulae.
