AB In this contribution a view is given of the current state of agricultural modelling in the UK. I begin with the ontogeny of this group. A brief description of modelling is presented to define the conceptual framework. The importance of modelling objectives is stressed. The possible significance of the avalanche of data now coming from the high-through-put techniques in the '-omics' research areas (genomics, proteomics and metabolomics) is discussed.
