AB Importance of the field: Post-genome drug development has been driven by the need to study biological perturbations at the molecular system level. Systems biology visualization tools can help researchers extract hidden patterns from complex and large Omics data sets, model disease molecular mechanisms, and identify drug targets and drugs with good pharmacological and toxicological profiles.
