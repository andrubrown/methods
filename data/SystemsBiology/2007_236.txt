AB Sunlight's UVB radiation triggers cell signaling at multiple sites to induce apoptosis. The integration of these signal entry sites is not understood. Here we show that P53 and E2f1 constitute a UVinducible apoptosis switch. At low-IUV doses, wild-type cells resemble the OFF state of an siPS3-treated cell, whereas at high-UV doses, the apoptosis frequency transitions to the fully ON behavior of an siE2fl-treated cell. The switch's target is l3cl-2: Rapid Bcl-2 down-regulation in response to UVB-induced DNA photoproducts is lost in P53-clef icient cells, but, as for apoptosis, is restored when both P53 and its inhibited target E2f1 are absent. P53's downregulation of l3cl-2 is mediated entirely through E2fl. Bcl-2 is also down-regulated by a separate pathway triggered by DNA photoproducts in the absence of P53 and E2fl. Four UV pathways terminating on Bcl-2 contribute to apoptosis after UVB irradiation. The apoptosis lost in p53(-/-) is completely restored by siBcl-2, implying that l3cl-2 is a rate-limiting member of this network. These results identify Bcl-2 as an integrator of several UV-induced proapoptotic signals and show that it, in turn, suppresses a direct IUV apoptosis pathway. UV-induced apoptosis requires both UV activation of the direct pathway and a separate UIV disinhibition of this pathway through P53-E2f 1-Bcl-2.
