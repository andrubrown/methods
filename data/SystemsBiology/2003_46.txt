AB The deduction of phenotypic cellular responses from the structure and behavior of complex gene regulatory networks is one of the defining challenges of systems biology. This goal will require a quantitative understanding of the modular components that constitute such networks. We pursued an integrated approach, combining theory and experiment, to analyze and describe the dynamics of an isolated genetic module, an in vivo autoregulatory gene network. As predicted by the model, temperature-induced protein destabilization led to the existence of two expression states, thus elucidating the trademark bistability of the positive feedback-network architecture. After sweeping the temperature, observed population distributions and coefficients of variation were in quantitative agreement with those predicted by a stochastic version of the model. Because model fluctuations originated from small molecule-number effects, the experimental validation underscores the importance of internal noise in gene expression. This work demonstrates that isolated gene networks, coupled with proper quantitative descriptions, can elucidate key properties of functional genetic modules. Such an approach could lead to the modular dissection of naturally occurring gene regulatory networks, the deduction of cellular processes such as differentiation, and the development of engineered cellular control.
