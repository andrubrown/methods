AB Motivation: Systems biology is currently focused on integrating intracellular networks, although clinically, diseases are largely defined by their histological features. For example, no computational model can simulate today the formation of a horizontally layered epidermis. Since the epidermis is the most complex structured epithelial tissue, systems biology models could yield important insights in epithelial tissue, in which most of all human cancers arise.
