AB Since 1960s unexpected communication activity between signaling pathways and signaling molecules in cells has been very often observed. As there is no biological theory to interpret it, this activity has been termed as crosstalk, unwanted communication. So far, no computer or statistical models have been developed for modeling crosstalk between signaling proteins although studying crosstalk between signaling pathways in wet laboratory has been one of the main stream. As the first attempt in the world, we have investigated multivariate crosstalk models. The simulation shows that such statistical crosstalk models work very well although more investigations are needed.
