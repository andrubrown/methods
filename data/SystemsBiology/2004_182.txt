AB As a result of the enormous amount of information that has been collected with E. coli over the past half century (e.g. genome sequence, mutant phenotypes, metabolic and regulatory networks, etc.), we now have detailed knowledge about gene regulation, protein activity, several hundred enzyme reactions, metabolic pathways, macromolecular machines, and regulatory interactions for this model organism. However, understanding how all these processes interact to form a living cell will require further characterization, quantification, data integration, and mathematical modeling, systems biology. No organism can rival E. coli with respect to the amount of available basic information and experimental tractability for the technologies needed for this undertaking. A focused, systematic effort to understand the E. coli cell will accelerate the development of new post-genomic technologies, including both experimental and computational tools. It will also lead to new technologies that will be applicable to other organisms, from microbes to plants, animals, and humans. E. coli is not only the best studied free-living model organism, but is also an extensively used microbe for industrial applications, especially for the production of small molecules of interest. It is an excellent representative of Gram-negative commensal bacteria. E. coli may represent a perfect model organism for systems biology that is aimed at elucidating both its free-living and commensal life-styles, which should open the door to whole-cell modeling and simulation.
