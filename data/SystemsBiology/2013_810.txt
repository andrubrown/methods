AB Systems biology and synthetic biology are said to represent 'two sides of the same coin,' with systems biology focussing on understanding and synthetic biology on construction. This notion is based on the implicit assumption that understanding and construction (or science and engineering) are, in themselves, 'two sides of the same coin.' Moreover, synthetic biology has been framed as an approach that encompasses understanding as well as control, construction, and creation. In the 'talking' and 'doing' of synthetic biology, one can discern a contemplative, interventionist, constructionist, and creationist stance. It is the aim of this paper to illustrate these stances in detail and to discuss more generally their techno-epistemic and socio-political implications. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.
