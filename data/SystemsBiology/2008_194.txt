AB We introduce the Beta Workbench (BWB), a scalable tool built on top of the newly defined BlenX language to model, simulate and analyse biological systems. We show the features and the incremental modelling process supported by the BWB on a running example based on the mitogen-activated kinase pathway. Finally, we provide a comparison with related approaches and some hints for future extensions.
