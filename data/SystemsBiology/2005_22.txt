AB The concept of systems-based strategies in medicine is emerging, with systems pathology guiding an understanding of the multidimensional aspects of disease system fingerprints and systems pharmacology providing insight into dynamic system responses upon (multiple) drug perturbations. Knowledge of the changes of system characteristics during disease progression creates a framework for the design of novel combinatorial treatment strategies. Such a systems-based, combinatorial-therapies approach readdresses the value of the synergistic actions of components of treatments based on natural products and highlights new methodology to study multidimensional intervention via reversed-pharmacology.
