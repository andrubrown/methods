AB Living cells are extremely well-organized autonomous systems, consisting of discrete interacting components. Key to understanding and modeling their behavior is modeling their system organization. Four distinct chemical toolkits (classes of macromolecules) have been characterized, each combinatorial in nature. Each toolkit consists of a small number of simple components that are assembled (polymerized) into complex structures that interact in rich ways. Each toolkit abstracts away from chemistry; it embodies an abstract machine with its own instruction set and its own peculiar interaction model. These interaction models are highly effective, but are not ones commonly used in computing: proteins stick together, genes have fixed output, membranes carry activity on their surfaces. Biologists have invented a number of notations attempting to describe these abstract machines and the processes they implement. Moving up from molecular biology, systems biology aims to understand how these interaction models work, separately and together.
