AB Systems biology seeks to explain complex biological systems, such as the cell, through the integration of many different types of information. Here, we discuss how the incorporation of high-resolution structural data can provide key molecular details often necessary to understand the complex connection between individual molecules and cell behavior. We suggest a process of zooming on the cell, from global networks through pathways to the precise atomic contacts at the interfaces of interacting proteins.
