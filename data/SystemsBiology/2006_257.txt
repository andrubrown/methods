AB Recent developments in genomic and post-genomic technologies have led to the amassment of data describing genome sequences, transcript, protein and metabolite abundances, protein modifications, and protein-protein and protein-DNA interactions. Such technologies have vastly expanded the inventory of detectable molecular species and can be used to describe their interdependence, but they have yet to fulfill their promise in enhancing our knowledge of how flux through metabolic pathways is regulated. A convergence of traditional reductionistic and novel holistic experimental approaches could aid in elucidating flux control.
