AB Motivation: In this paper we propose to use recent developments in knowledge representation languages and reasoning methodologies for representing and reasoning about signaling networks. Our approach is different from most other qualitative systems biology approaches in that it is based on reasoning ( or inferencing) rather than simulation. Some of the advantages of our approach are, we can use recent advances in reasoning with incomplete and partial information to deal with gaps in signal network knowledge; and can perform various kinds of reasoning such as planning, hypothetical reasoning and explaining observations.
