AB The response of biological cells to environmental change is coordinated by protein-based signaling networks. These networks are to be found in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes. In eukaryotes, the signaling networks can be highly complex, some networks comprising of 60 or more proteins. The fundamental motif that has been found in all signaling networks is the protein phosphorylation/dephosphorylation cycle-the cascade cycle. At this time, the computational function of many of the signaling networks is poorly understood. However, it is clear that it is possible to construct a huge variety of control and computational circuits, both analog and digital from combinations of the cascade cycle. In this review, we will summarize the great versatility of the simple cascade cycle as a computational unit and towards the end give two examples, one prokaryotic chemotaxis circuit and the other, the eukaryotic MAPK cascade.
