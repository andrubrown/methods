AB An improved bioinformatics visual programming prototype system VBP that aims to visualise highly complicated bioinformatical data is described. In this paper, we describe the integration of Focus+Context algorithm and bio-visual programming to show the dynamic adjusting of Focusing on details without losing the context simultaneously. Because of this flexible and interactive architecture, VBP makes an ideal bio-visual programming tool for future bioinformatics or systems biology research.
