AB Despite advances with adjuvant endocrine treatment for hormone receptor-positive tumors and with trastuzumab for HER2-positive disease, overall, over 50% of women with early-stage breast cancer experience recurrence and die of the disease. Biomarkers for tailoring systemic adjuvant treatment to responder patients are needed. The multigene assays, 21-gene recurrence score (Oncotype DX (R) [Genomic Health, CA, USA]) and 70-gene signature (MammaPrint (TM) [Agendia, CA, USA]), and the isolated tumor cells in sentinel lymph node(s) represent the latest advances for improving adjuvant chemotherapy decisions. This article evaluates how these new markers, added to current standard factors (age, tumor size, grade, hormone receptor status and HER2 status), could improve early breast cancer treatment decisions. Moreover, emerging evidence from the latest large-scale studies using next-generation DNA-sequencing technology reveals a high heterogeneity and complexity of breast cancer. This assessment now shapes a new research strategy towards completion of a breast cancer causal (driver) mutations catalog and understanding complex genetic interactions and signaling pathway networks. Despite multiple challenges, advances in cancer genomes and systems biology approaches promise the future development of robust biomarkers.
