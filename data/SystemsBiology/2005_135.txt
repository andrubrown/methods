AB Plasma is one of the best studied compartments in the human body and serves as an ideal body fluid for the diagnosis of diseases. This report provides a detailed functional annotation of all the plasma proteins identified to date. In all, gene products encoded by 3778 distinct genes were annotated based on proteins previously published in the literature as plasma proteins and the identification of multiple peptides from proteins under HUPO's Plasma Proteome Project. Our analysis revealed that 51% of these genes encoded more than one protein isoform. All single nucleotide polymorphisms involving protein-coding regions were mapped onto the protein sequences. We found a number of examples of isoform-specific subcellular localization as well as tissue expression. This database is an attempt at comprehensive annotation of a complex sub-proteome and is available on the web at http://www.plasmaproteomedatabase.org.
