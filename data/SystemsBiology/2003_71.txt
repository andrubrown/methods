AB Comparative physiology has proven a powerful approach to our understanding of how animals function under hypoxic conditions and to identifying potential adaptations to environmental oxygen levels. This review considers the potential for using a similar comparative approach with functional genomics to understand the genetic basis of such physiological processes and evolutionary adaptations. Comparative functional genomics is currently limited by genome data, which are available for only a few model organisms. However, comparative studies between model organisms of the same species having slightly different genomes (e.g., in-bred strains of laboratory rodents, transgenic mice, and consomic rats) demonstrate the types of results, as well as the analytical challenges, that are possible if comparative functional genomics is applied to more species. Results from wild and domestic animal studies suggest new models to investigate physiological and evolutionary responses to oxygen levels with functional genomics.
