AB Systems biology is a new, fashionable and well-funded discipline, which to quote from a recent review aims to 'examine the structure and dynamics of cellular and organismal function, rather than the characteristics of isolated parts of a cell or organism...' (Kitano, H. (2002) Science 295:1662-1664). Systems biology will do this by profiting from the vast amounts of biological information that are available in the genomics era and make extensive use of computer modelling. But: 'many breakthroughs in experimental devices, advanced software and analytical methods are required before the achievements of system biology can live up to their much-touted potential'. This edition of Molecular Microbiology contains a paper that is the product of traditional experimental biology but which could serve as a test case for systems biology. The paper shows how bacteria integrate such disparate subsystems as DNA restriction, homologous recombination and regulated proteolysis to protect their chromosomes from degradation. When systems biology can predict this level of choreography, it will be a mature discipline.
