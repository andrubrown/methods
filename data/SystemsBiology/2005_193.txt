AB Proteins are the key components of the cellular machinery responsible for processing changes that are ordered by genomic information. Analysis of most human proteins and nucleic acids is important in order to decode the complex networks that are likely to underlie many common diseases. Significant improvements in current technology are also required to dissect the regulatory processes in high-throughtput and with low cost. Miniaturization of biological assays is an important prerequisite to achieve these goals in the near future.
