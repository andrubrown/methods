AB An optical fiber based well array platform was used for simultaneous, dynamic gene expression monitoring from hundreds of individual live Escherichia coli cells carrying promoter-fluorescent reporter gene fusions. High information content about gene expression kinetics and cell-to-cell gene expression variability can be collected from a single experiment. These data are invaluable for investigating gene regulation and gene networks as well as for systems biology applications.
