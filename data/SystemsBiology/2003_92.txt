AB This paper describes jcc, an integration of the timed default concurrent constraint programming framework [16] (Timed Default cc) into JAVA [7]. jcc is intended for use in education and research, for the programming of embedded reactive systems, for parallel/distributed simulation and modelling (particularly for space, robotics and systems biology applications), and to support the development of constraint-based program analysis and type-checking tools.
