AB Systems biology strives to derive accurate predictive descriptions of complex systems such as innate immunity, The innate immune system is essential for host defense, yet the resulting inflammatory response must be tightly regulated. Current understanding indicates that this system is controlled by complex regulatory networks, which maintain homoeostasis while accurately distinguishing pathogenic infections from harmless exposures. Recent studies have used high throughput technologies and computational techniques that presage predictive models and will be the foundation of a systems level understanding of innate immunity.
