AB Genetic regulatory networks have been modeled as discrete transition systems by many approaches, benefiting from a large number of formal verification algorithms available for the analysis of discrete transition systems. However, most of these approaches do not scale up well. In this article, we explore the use of compositionality for the analysis of genetic regulatory networks. We present a framework for modeling genetic regulatory networks in a modular yet faithful manner based on the mathematically well-founded formalism of differential inclusions. We then propose a compositional algorithm to efficiently analyze reachability properties of the model. A case study shows the potential of this approach.
