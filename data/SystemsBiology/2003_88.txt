AB In silico models of Escherichia coli metabolism have been developed to predict metabolic behavior and propose experimentally testable hypotheses. However, a thorough assessment of the metabolic phenotype requires well-designed experimentation and reproducible experimental techniques. A method for the quantitative analysis of E. coli metabolism in vivo within the framework of in silico phenotypic phase plane analysis is presented. Using this approach, we have quantitatively studied E. coli metabolism in various environmental conditions and nutritional media. Our experimental methodology, in combination with steady-state metabolic models, can be used to study biological properties and evaluate the metabolic capabilities of microbes. Copyright (C) 2003 S.
