AB Background: In the last decade, techniques were established for the large scale genome-wide analysis of proteins, RNA, and metabolites, and database solutions have been developed to manage the generated data sets. The Golm Metabolome Database for metabolite data (GMD) represents one such effort to make these data broadly available and to interconnect the different molecular levels of a biological system [1]. As data interpretation in the light of already existing data becomes increasingly important, these initiatives are an essential part of current and future systems biology.
