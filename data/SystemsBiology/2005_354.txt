AB Recent advances in developmental biology have yielded detailed models of gene regulatory networks (GRNs) involved in cell specification and other processes in embryonic differentiation. Such networks form the bedrock on which a systems biology approach to developmental toxicology can be built. In this review, an introduction to GRNs in general is followed by a description of specific networks involved in sea urchin and Drosophila development. A hypothesis is presented regarding the role of GRN analysis in the determination of mechanisms of chemical toxicity during embryonic development. Potential for future directions and research approaches in this area is discussed. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.
