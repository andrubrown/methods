AB The metabolome represents the collection of all metabolites in a biological cell, tissue, organ or organism, which are the end-products of cellular processes. Metabolomics is the systematic study of small-molecule metabolite profiles that specific cellular processes leave behind. RNA messenger gene expression data and proteomic analyses do not tell the whole story of what might be happening in a cell. Metabolic profiling, in turn, amplifies changes both in the proteome and the genome, and represents a more accurate approximation to the phenotype of an organism in health and disease. In this article, we have provided a description of metabolomics, in the presence of other, more familiar 'omics' disciplines, such as genomics and proteomics. In addition, we have reviewed the current rationale for metabolomics in cardiology, its basic methodology and the data actually available in human studies in this discipline. The discussed topics highlight the importance of being able to use the metabolomics information in order to understand disease mechanisms from a systems biology perspective as a noninvasive approach to diagnose, grade and treat cardiovascular diseases.
