AB The functions of approximately one-third of the proteins encoded by the Arabidopsis thaliana genome are completely unknown. Moreover, many annotations of the remainder of the genome supply tentative functions, at best. Knowing the ultimate localization of these proteins, as well as the pathways used for getting there, may provide clues as to their functions. The putative localization of most proteins currently relies on in silico-based bioinformatics approaches, which, unfortunately, often result in erroneous predictions. Emerging proteomics techniques coupled with other systems biology approaches now provide researchers with a plethora of methods for elucidating the final location of these proteins on a large scale, as well as the ability to dissect protein-sorting pathways in plants.
