AB The cell division cycle is a fundamental process of cell biology and a detailed understanding of its function, regulation and other underlying mechanisms is critical to many applications in biotechnology and medicine. Since a comprehensive analysis of the molecular mechanisms involved is too complex to be performed intuitively, mathematical and computational modelling techniques are essential. This paper is a review and analysis of recent approaches attempting to model cell cycle regulation by means of protein-protein interaction networks.
