AB Human physiological functions are regulated across many orders of magnitude in space and time. Integrating the information and dynamics from one scale to another is critical for the understanding of human physiology and the treatment of diseases. Multi-scale modeling, as a computational approach, has been widely adopted by researchers in computational and systems biology. A key unsolved issue is how to represent appropriately the dynamical behaviors of a high-dimensional model of a lower scale by a low-dimensional model of a higher scale, so that it can be used to investigate complex dynamical behaviors at even higher scales of integration. In the article, we first review the widely-used different modeling methodologies and their applications at different scales. We then discuss the gaps between different modeling methodologies and between scales, and discuss potential methods for bridging the gaps between scales. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.
