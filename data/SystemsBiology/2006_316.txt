AB OBJECTIVE. Many chronic diseases exhibit characteristic pulmonary distribution patterns, but the underlying biologic explanations remain elusive. On the basis of emerging evidence from systems biology, we propose that gradients of T helper immune function exist as an epiphenomenon of the hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction response. Regional variation of immune function may contribute to preferential distribution patterning of lung diseases.
