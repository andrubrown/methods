AB In recent years biophysical approaches have had particular impact on the progress in physiological and biological research. In systems biology such progress is often associated with the terms "noise" and "chaos". The introduction of these physically based concepts into life sciences has essentially been promoted by the work of Frank Moss and his group. This paper provides evidence of the physiological relevance of such biophysically based approaches with examples from quite different physiological and pathophysiological functions like temperature transduction in peripheral sensory receptors and the progression of mood disorders. We will use modelling studies, based on experimental and clinical data, to illustrate that both systems can attain specific dynamical states where chaos and/or noise plays an essential role and we will try to describe under which conditions functionally relevant noise effects or chaotic behaviour can be expected.
