AB Buchnera aphidicola is the primary obligate intracellular symbiont of most aphid species. B. aphidicola and aphids have been evolving in parallel since their association started, about 150 Myr ago. Both partners have lost their autonomy, and aphid diversification has been confined to smaller ecological niches by this co-evolution. B. aphidicola has undergone major genomic and biochemical changes as a result of adapting to intracellular life. Several genomes of B. aphidicola from different aphid species have been sequenced in the last decade, making it possible to carry out analyses and comparative studies using system-level in silico methods. This review attempts to provide a systemic description of the symbiotic function of aphid endosymbionts, particularly of B. aphidicola from the pea aphid Acyrthosiphon pisum, by analyzing their structural genomic properties, as well as their genetic and metabolic networks.
