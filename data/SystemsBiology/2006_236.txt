AB NMR-based metabolic profiling techniques can simultaneously track changes in many plant metabolites and have found a number of applications in both systems biology and biosafety. Together with multivariate statistical analyses, NMR spectroscopy has been successfully applied to the characterisation of various herbs and plant products for quality control, authentication, determining geographical origin and for detecting adulteration of products. Additionally, the metabolic consequences of plant extracts have been demonstrated in experimental animals and in man using NMR-based metabonomics approaches to characterise the response. Here the application of NMR spectroscopy and chemometric tools for analysing plant-based products and their metabolic consequences are considered with particular emphasis on deconvolving biological complexity and minimising confounding biological variability with analytical 'noise'.
