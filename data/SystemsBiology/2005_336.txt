AB In recent years bacterial protein-tyrosine kinases have been found to phosphorylate a growing number of protein substrates, including RNA polymerase sigma factors, UDP-glucose dehydrogenases and single-stranded DNA-binding proteins. The activity of these protein substrates was affected by tyrosine phosphorylation, indicating that this post-translational modification could regulate physiological processes ranging from stress response and exopolysaccharide synthesis to DNA metabolism. Some interesting work in this field was done in Bacillus subtilis, and we here present the current state of knowledge on protein-tyrosine phosphorylation in this gram-positive model organism. With its two kinases, two kinase modulators, three phosphatases and at least four different tyrosine-phosphorylated substrates, B. subtilis is the bacterium with the highest number of presently known participants in the global network of protein-tyrosine phosphorylation. We discuss the approaches currently used to chart this network: ranging from studies of substrate specificity and the physiological role of tyrosine phosphorylation of individual enzymes to the global approaches at the level of systems biology.
