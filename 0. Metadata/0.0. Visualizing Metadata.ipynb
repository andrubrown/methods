    "[RDF (**R**esource **D**escription **F**ramework)](https://www.w3.org/RDF/) is a data model for information on the internet. It can be used to describe just about anything, but is usually applied to bibliographic collections: representing metadata about published documents. \n",
    "\n",
    "[RDF XML](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-syntax-grammar/) is a grammar/serialization format for representing RDF. There are other ways of representing RDF, like [N-triples](https://www.w3.org/TR/n-triples/), [Turtle](https://www.w3.org/TR/turtle/), and [JSON-LD](http://manu.sporny.org/2014/json-ld-origins-2/).\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the core concepts of RDF is representing (meta)data as a graph. Every element of the RDF document (a file containing RDF statements) is a **node** in the graph: articles, people, journals, literals (like volume numbers), etc. These **nodes** are called **resources**. Resources are linked together in **triples**: tri-partite statements consisting of a subject, a predicate, and an object.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we'll convert a simple [Zotero RDF/XML](https://forums.zotero.org/discussion/29807/zotero-rdf-documentation/) document into a [GraphML](http://graphml.graphdrawing.org/) graph (a graph serialization format) and visualize that graph using [Cytoscape](http://cytoscape.org).\n",

    "--------   --------------------------------------------\n",
    "**Note**   *This exercise is intended only to introduce you to RDF and graphs, and isn't something that you are likely to do as part of an analysis. There is a sample RDF/XML file included in the ``data`` subdirectory, describing a single document. Use that file to start. You can try this with your own RDF if you want, but even a moderate number of documents will lead to extremely large and unweildy graphs. So, be careful.*\n",
