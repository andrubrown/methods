 Edward B. LewisEdward B. Lewis studied embryonic development in 
		Drosophila, including the discovery of the 
		cis-trans test for recessive genes, and the identification of the bithorax complex and its role in development in 
		Drosophila.  He shared the 1995 
		Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine with Christiane Nüsslein-Volhard and Eric F. Wieschaus for work on genetic control of early embryonic development.
Edward B. Lewis was born on 20 May 1918 in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania, to Laura Mary and Edward Butts Lewis, a watchmaker and jeweler. By the time he was a freshman in high school Lewis had a budding interest in biology. He ordered 
		Drosophila cultures from an advertisement in the back of Science Magazine and began rudimentary studies of the organism. Lewis’s interests were not confined to science alone. He was also an accomplished flautist, and took a music scholarship to 
		Bucknell College. After a year at Bucknell he decided to transfer to the 
		University of Minnesota, in large part because of the inexpensive, twenty-five dollar out-of-state tuition. 
At the 
		University of Minnesota, he was encouraged by a genetics professor, Clarence Paul Oliver, to continue his hobby of 
		Drosophila research. Lewis was granted a desk in Oliver's lab to continue his research. It took him just two years to receive a Bachelor of Arts degree in biostatistics. A recommendation from Oliver helped Lewis obtain a teaching fellowship at the 
		California Institute of Technology as a graduate student under 
		Alfred Sturtevant. Lewis published many papers during his time as a graduate student, but his most important paper outlined the 
		cis-trans test, also known as the complementation test. This test is used to determine whether two independent, recessive mutations are located on the same gene or separate genes. This discovery led Lewis to a PhD from the 
		California Institute of Technology in 1942. The next year, in the midst of World War II, Lewis enlisted in the Army to help the American war effort. As a Captain in the Army, Lewis served three years as a meteorologist and an oceanographer in Hawaii and in Okinawa, Japan. After the war ended Lewis returned to the 
		California Institute of Technology in 1946 as an instructor, a position promised him by the 
		California Institute of Technology President Robert Millikan in 1942. In 1946 he married Pamela Harrah, an arrangement encouraged by 
		George Wells Beadle who hoped to keep Harrah in his lab so she could continue to maintain his stock 
		Drosophila collection. Regardless of the motivation, the marriage between Lewis and Harrah stuck.
In 1956 Lewis became a Professor of Biology at the 
		California Institute of Technology. One of Lewis’s most famous 
		Drosophila mutants was known as the four-winged fly. Due to a mutation in the 
		bithorax complex—Lewis's favorite gene complex—the body segments were transformed and an extra set of wings developed. Lewis was known throughout his career as a maverick scientist, one who published rarely and believed in practicing science for the sake of science. At the beginning of the nuclear age, in 1957, low-level 
		radiation was thought to be safe. Lewis disagreed and published a paper the same year, “Leukemia and Ionizing Radiation,” outlining the negative effects of low-level 
		radiation. He was able to demonstrate a correlation between the accepted “safe” levels of 
		radiation and increased cases of leukemia. Because of this paper, he was forced to appear before the Joint Committee on Atomic Energy to testify on his findings.
In 1966 Lewis was named the Morgan Professor of Biology and became an emeritus professor at the 
		California Institute of Technology in 1988. His many awards and memberships include becoming a Rockefeller Foundation fellow in 1947 and a guest professor at the Institute of Genetics at the 
		University of Copenhagen, Denmark, from 1975 to 1976. He was awarded the Thomas Hunt Morgan Medal in 1983, won the Gairdner Foundation International Award in 1987, and the Wolf Foundation Prize in Medicine for 1989. He won the Rosenstiel Award and the National Medal of Science in 1990, the 
		Albert Lasker Basic Medical Research Award in 1991, the Louisa Gross Horwitz Prize for 1992, and culminated with the 
		Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for 1995. He was a member of the National Academy of Sciences, the Genetics Society of America, the American Philosophical Society, the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, a foreign member of the Royal Society of London, and an honorary member of the Genetical Society of Great Britain. 
On 21 July 2004 Lewis succumbed to prostate cancer. He had continued to work through his illness until his final days.
