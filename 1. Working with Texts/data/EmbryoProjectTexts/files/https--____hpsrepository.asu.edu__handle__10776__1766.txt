 "Experiments on Embryonic Induction III. A Note on Inductions by Chick Primitive Streak Transplanted to the Rabbit Embryo" (1934) by Conrad Hal Waddington
		Conrad Hal Waddington’s “Experiments on Embryonic Induction III,” published in 1934 in the Journal of Experimental Biology, describes the discovery that the 
		primitive streak induces the mammalian embryo.  
		Waddington’s hypothesis was that a transplanted 
		primitive streak could induce neural tissue in the ectoderm of the 
		rabbit embryo.  The 
		primitive streak defines the axis of an embryo and is capable of inducing the differentiation of various tissues in a developing embryo during gastrulation.  In this experiment 
		Waddington was, in fact, able to induce neural differentiation.  
		Waddington noted that the tissue is “competent” for a 
		chick
organizer, and by deduction a mammalian 
		organizer must exist.  
		Competence refers to a cell's ability to respond to an inducing signal, which is temporally limited to certain developmental stages.  
		Waddington’s initial work laid the foundation for many decades of research to follow, including further experiments by 
		Waddington with the mammalian 
		organizer.

		Waddington’s inspiration for this as well as previous 
		induction experiments came from 
		Hans Spemann’s discovery of the 
		amphibian 
		organizer.  Prior to 1929 
		Waddington had pursued a ScD in geology; however, thanks to inspiration he derived from 
		Spemann’s discoveries and his friendship with geneticist 
		Gregory Bateson, 
		Waddington switched fields to study 
		embryology at the 
		Strangeways Research Laboratory.  His early work at 
		Strangeways focused on the 
		amphibian 
		organizer.  In 1932, as part of this line of research, he confirmed the presence of organizing tissue in 
		chick and 
		duck embryos, which led the way for his experiments on the mammalian embryo.
The 
		rabbit embryo was not simple to culture in vitro.  Therefore, 
		Waddington first needed to develop a more stable method to allow for transplantation experiments.  
		Waddington expanded on his own earlier method of culturing 
		chick embryos on coagulated plasma from an adult chicken and 
		chick embryo extract.  They were successful in culturing the 
		rabbit embryo on this substrate up to the development of six somite pairs.  Once this stable method of culturing the mammalian embryo was tested, 
		Waddington was able to move on to transplanting organizer tissue from the 
		chick to the 
		rabbit.

		Waddington intended to induce neural plate formation by grafting a 
		chick
organizer into the 
		rabbit embryo.  For this experiment, as he did in his earlier work, he utilized plasma coagulate and 
		chick extract as the culture medium.  
		Rat or 
		rabbit extract showed no improvement over 
		chick extract in development of the embryo.  Since the 
		rabbit embryo was more difficult to manipulate, in this experiment the 
		chick primitive streak was transplanted to a pocket between the ectoderm and endoderm.  
		Waddington noted the difficulties encountered during the manipulation of the 
		rabbit embryo are due to its “transparency, toughness, and stickiness.”  In this experiment two embryos were shown to have developed neural tissue in the presence of the 
		chick primitive streak.
This experiment thus demonstrated the presence of tissue competent for 
		induction by a chick organizer in the mammalian embryo.  Although the mammalian organizer itself was not directly identified in this experiment, its presence was deduced by the action of the grafted primitive streak from the 
		chick.  
		Waddington surmised that the action of the mammalian 
		organizer was very similar to 
		organizers discovered in birds and amphibia, and that the lack of species specificity showed that the inducing agents were highly conserved across species.
