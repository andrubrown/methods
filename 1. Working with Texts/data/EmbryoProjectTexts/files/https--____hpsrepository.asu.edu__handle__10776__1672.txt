 Stanley CohenStanley Cohen is a biochemist who participated in the discovery of 
		nerve growth factor (NGF) and 
		epidermal growth factor (EGF).  He shared the 1986 
		Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine with 
		Rita Levi-Montalcini for their work on the discovery of growth factors.  His work led to the discovery of many other growth factors and their roles in development.
Stanley Cohen was born on 17 November 1922 in Brooklyn, New York.  His father was a tailor and his mother a housewife who immigrated to the United States from Russia in the early 1900s.  Cohen spent his early education in the New York City public school system, and attended the city college, 
		Brooklyn College, for his undergraduate studies.  
		Brooklyn College had no tuition, which allowed him the opportunity to attend the school.   He majored in Biology and Chemistry and earned a bachelor’s degree in 1943.
To save money for graduate school he worked as a bacteriologist in a milk processing plant.  Cohen earned an MA in zoology from 
		Oberlin College in 1945.  In 1948 he earned a PhD from the 
		University of Michigan for 
		earthworm research.  Cohen studied the metabolic mechanism for the change in production from ammonia to urea during times of starvation.  He collected more than 5000 
		worms from his campus for his research.  After earning a PhD, Cohen worked in pediatrics and biochemistry at the 
		University of Colorado under Harry Gordon.  He studied metabolism in premature infants.  In 1952 Cohen joined the 
		Washington University Department of Radiology as a postdoctoral fellow of the American Cancer Society under Martin Kamen.  At 
		Washington University Cohen noted his participation in the journal club with Arthur Kornberg as a priceless experience.
In 1953 Cohen joined the zoology department to work with 
		Viktor Hamburger and 
		Rita Levi-Montalcini.  His first project was to isolate 
		nerve growth factor from sarcoma 180—a tumor which causes extreme nerve growth in spinal and sympathetic ganglia of the 
		chick.  In characterizing the isolate, Cohen used 
		snake venom to test the characteristics of the 
		nerve growth factor, but instead discovered that 
		snake venom included large amounts of growth factor.  Further experimentation showed the 
		nerve growth factor to be present in 
		mouse salivary glands.  These salivary glands contained much more 
		NGF than any known tissue, which allowed Cohen to purify them in significant amounts.  He used 
		mouse salivary glands to determine the molecular weight of nerve growth factor in 1960.  Cohen played an active role in the later characterization of 
		nerve growth factor.
In 1959 Cohen accepted the position of assistant professor in the biochemistry department of 
		Vanderbilt University.  Further experimentation on 
		NGF led him to the discovery of 
		epidermal growth factor in 1960.  When Cohen injected 
		mice with 
		mouse salivary extract, their eyelids opened and their teeth erupted early.  He isolated 
		epidermal growth factor in 1962, and sequenced 
		epidermal growth factor in 1972.  Cohen was promoted to full professor in 1967 and he became an American Cancer Society Research Professor in 1976.  He was made a Distinguished Professor in 1986 at 
		Vanderbilt University.  Upon his retirement in 2000, he was named Emeritus Professor.
Stanley Cohen has received many awards including the 1986 
		Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine with 
		Rita Levi-Montalcini.  He was inducted into the National Academy of Science in 1980, and received the Lewis S. Rosenstiel Award and the Alfred P. Sloan award in 1982.  He was awarded the Louisa Gross Horowitz Prize in 1983 and inducted into the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1984.  Cohen was awarded the National Medal of Science and the 
		Albert Lasker Basic Medical Research Award in 1986.  He was also honored as a member of a Uganda Stamp series featuring Nobel Prize Winners.
