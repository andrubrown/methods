 Gregory Goodwin PincusGregory Goodwin Pincus, one of the original researchers responsible for the development of the first 
		oral contraceptive pill, was born in Woodbine, New Jersey, on 19 April 1903 to Russian Jewish parents. In 1924 Pincus received his BS degree from 
		Cornell University, and in 1927 he received his MS and PhD from 
		Harvard University, having studied under 
		William Ernest Castle and 
		William John Crozier. After this, Pincus studied at 
		Cambridge University with Francis Hugh Adam Marshall and John Hammond, both reproductive biologists, and at the 
		Kaiser Wilhelm Institute with 
		Richard Goldschmidt, a geneticist.
In 1931 Pincus was appointed assistant professor at 
		Harvard University but lost his tenure due to negative publicity related to his
in vitro fertilization experiments with 
		rabbits. In 1936 he published
The Eggs of Mammals and in 1944 founded the 
		Worcester Foundation for Experimental Biology with his colleague, 
		Hudson Hoagland. 
Pincus participated in many areas of endocrinology and reproductive biology but is best known for developing the 
		birth control pill. In 1951 he and 
		Min Chueh Chang began studies on the effects of 
		progesterone and synthesized 
		progestin in 
		rabbits. This research was promoted by 
		Margaret Sanger, who had conceptualized the idea of a hormonal birth control and approached Pincus about the possibility of creating this technology. In 1953 
		Katharine Dexter McCormick, a friend of 
		Sanger’s, pledged to fund the birth control project to completion. 
Through his experiments with 
		rabbits and 
		rats, Pincus found that ovulation could be arrested through the administration of synthetic progesterone 
		(progestin). When it was time to conduct clinical trials with 
		humans, Pincus asked 
		John Charles Rock, an obstetrician-gynecologist at 
		Harvard University Medical School to collaborate with him because of his prestigious position and his involvement in the 
		Catholic Church. In the US, and particularly in Massachusetts, laws against birth control posed barriers to this research. The first trials were conducted at the 
		Free Hospital for Women under the guise of fertility research and were later moved to Puerto Rico for large scale studies in collaboration with 
 		Celso-Ramón Garcia.
Pincus died 22 August 1967 in Boston, Massachusetts, from myeloid metaplasia, most likely caused by his work with chemicals. His work, in collaboration with others, is the basis for the creation of the hormonal 
		birth control pill.
