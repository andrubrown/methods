 Planned Parenthood v. Casey (1992)Almost ten years after the landmark decision in 
Roe v. Wade (1973) the battle over 
		abortion was still being waged.  The reproductive rights of women in the United States were being challenged by the 
		Pennsylvania Abortion Control Act of 1982.  The act was comprised of four provisions that restricted the fundamental right a woman had to obtaining an 
		abortion, as established in 
Roe v. Wade.  The four provisions included spousal notification, information disclosure, a twenty-four hour waiting period, and parental consent for minors.  
The US District Court of Eastern Pennsylvania declared all of the provisions to be unconstitutional when a suit was brought forward by five abortion clinics and a physician before the provisions went into effect.  However, the State Court of Appeals reversed this decision claiming that all provisions except the spousal notification were indeed constitutional.  
		Planned Parenthood of Southern Pennsylvania then appealed the courts decision to the US Supreme Court.
The oral argument for Planned Parenthood v. Casey (1992) began on 22 April 1992 with 
		Kathryn Kolbert representing Planned Parenthood of Southern Pennsylvania.  
		Kolbert argued that the provisions in the Pennsylvania Abortion Control Act of 1982 violated the decision made in Roe v. Wade that the right to an 
		abortion was fundamental.  If the fundamental right to 
		abortion were to be removed, women would be forced to back alleys to receive 
		abortions which would be detrimental to the woman’s life and health.  She also argued that the right to privacy would be dismantled if the provisions were upheld.
On 29 June 1992 a 5–4 majority vote upheld all of the provisions presented in the Pennsylvania Abortion Control Act except spousal notification and the Supreme Court once again reaffirmed the decision of Roe v. Wade.  The idea of “undue burden” was adopted in the decision.  An undue burden is present if the purpose is to impose obstacles that prevent a woman from obtaining an 
		abortion before the 
		fetus is viable.  The decision in Planned Parenthood v. Casey also did away with the 
		trimester framework established in Roe v. Wade and implemented in its place the concept of 
		viability.
The contentious court case Planned Parenthood v. Casey once again brought 
		reproductive rights into the public eye and forced the courts to either reaffirm or overturn Roe v. Wade.  Although the decision in Roe was ultimately reaffirmed, most agree that the provisions adopted by Planned Parenthood v. Casey began to chip away some of women’s reproductive rights.
