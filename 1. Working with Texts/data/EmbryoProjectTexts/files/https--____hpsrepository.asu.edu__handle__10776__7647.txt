 Lynn Petra Alexander Sagan Margulis (1938–2011)Lynn Petra Alexander Sagan Margulis
	studied cells and mitochondria in the US during the second half of the twentieth century. She
	developed a theory for the origin of eukaryotic cells. In that theory, she proposed that two kinds of structures
	found in eukaryotic cells, mitochondria in animals and plastids in plants, were once
	free-living bacteria that lived harmoniously and in close proximity to larger cells, a scenario
	called symbiosis. Margulis proposed that the larger cells eventually engulfed the free-living
	bacteria, resulting in cells living inside other cells, a situation called endosymbiosis.
	Margulis' theory is known as the serial endosymbiosis theory (SET). Her work contributed to
	explanations of the evolution and development of life, as eukaryotic cells comprise most
	multicellular organisms, including their embryos.
Margulis was born in Chicago, Illinois, on 5 March 1938, the oldest of four daughters born
	to Leona Wise Alexander and Morris Alexander, an attorney. Margulis applied for
	college at the age of fourteen, and she enrolled in the University of Chicago in
	Chicago, Illinois, by the age of sixteen. While there, she began to study genetics. She
	graduated from University of Chicago with a bachelor degree in liberal arts in 1957.
While at the University of Chicago, Margulis met her first husband, Carl Edward Sagan, a
	graduate student in physics who became an astronomer and popularizer of science. She married
	Sagan when she was nineteen years old. They moved to Madison, Wisconsin, where she studied with
	Walter Plaut and Hans Ris at the University of Wisconsin. 
	She completed her master's degree in zoology and genetics in 1960.
	Margulis and Sagan moved to California when Sagan took a post-doctoral position at University of
	California in Berkley, California. In the same year she began her PhD
	in genetics at University of California at Berkeley with zoologist Max Alfert. When Sagan joined Harvard University's astronomy department in 1963, Sagan and Margulis moved
	to Boston, Massachusetts.  Margulis and Sagan divorced in 1964.
Margulis took a lectureship at Brandeis University in Waltham, Massachusetts, and she
	moved there with her two sons, Dorion Sagan and Jeremy Sagan. While at Brandeis,
	Margulis finished her dissertation and obtained her PhD from University of California at
	Berkeley in 1965. She then began teaching in the biology department at Boston University, 
	in Boston, Massachusetts, where she remained for twenty-two years.
In 1967, while working at Boston University, Margulis published the article "On the Origin of
	Mitosing Cells." In the article, Margulis proposed her theory of symbiosis, which
	argued that eukaryotic cells, which have enclosed nuclei, evolved from
	free-living bacteria, which do not have enclosed nuclei, living closely together. She proposed
	that primitive eukaryotic cells engulfed an aerobic bacterium that later became the mitochondria. She
	later proposed her serial endosymbiosis theory (SET), which stated that some cells engulfed
	photosynthesizing cyanobacteria, which then became the plastids of algae and plants.
By 1970,
	Margulis was an associate professor at Boston University, and she expanded her theory of
	endosymbiosis in Origin of Eukaryotic Cells. She published two revised
	versions of this book as Symbiosis in Cell Evolution in 1981 and 1992.
	Meanwhile, during the 1980s, genetic analysis of the DNA of sub-cellular organelles confirmed her
	theory that mitochondria and plastids, chloroplasts in plants, were once free-living
	bacteria.
Margulis married chemist Thomas N. Margulis in 1967. While they were
	married they had a son Zachary, and a daughter Jennifer. They divorced in 1980. She later said
	that she quit her job as wife twice, saying that it is not humanly possible to be a good wife, a good
	mother, and a first class scientist. 
Margulis later advocated for a variant of the Gaia hypothesis, postulated in the 1960s by James Ephraim Lovelock in the UK. The
	hypothesis likens the earth to a living, self-regulating organism. Margulis worked with
	Lovelock in the early 1970s on a US National Space and Aeronautics Association (NASA) sponsored search for life on Mars, in which Lovelock looked for ways that life might
	have modified Mars's atmosphere. Lovelock and Margulis predicted that NASA's Viking space probe
	would find no life on Mars, which it didn't. Later, in 1993's "Gaia in Science," Margulis stated
	that Gaia was best hypothesized not as an organism, as in Lovelock's Gaia theory, but as an
	ecosystem. In her 1998 book Symbiotic Planet: A New Look at Evolution she focused on two
	specific theories and their relationship to each other: serial endosymbiosis theory (SET) and the Gaia
	hypothesis.
 Margulis left Boston University in 1988 and joined the faculty at the
	University of Massachusetts at Amherst, Massachusetts as Distinguished Professor of Botany. In
	1997 she moved to the Department of Geosciences. She was distinguished professor of geosciences
	at Amherst until her death in 2011.
 In addition to Margulis' scholarly publications, she
	wrote books for popular audiences. Some she wrote with her eldest son Dorion Sagan
	including Microcosmos: Four Billion Years of Microbial Evolution in 1986,
	and Acquiring Genomes: A theory of the Origins of Species in 2002.
 Margulis served on
	many US  and international science committees, including some for NASA, American
	Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS), American Academy of Arts and Sciences, World
	Academy of Arts and Sciences, and the National Science Resource Center. She was elected President of
	the Scientific Research Society Sigma Xi for 2005 to 2006. She was one of three US members on
	the Russian Academy of Natural Sciences. Margulis also consulted for NASA on
	biological and geological research.
 Margulis received many awards. She was elected to
	the US National Academy of Sciences in 1983 and received the US National Medal of
	Science in 1999 presented at the White House by US President Bill Clinton in March
	2000. In 1999 she received the William Procter Prize for Scientific Achievement from
	Sigma Xi. This organization treats this prize as its highest honor, awarded to scientists who
	made outstanding contributions to research and who communicate the significance of their work to
	others. Her other awards include a NASA Public Service Award for Astrobiology in 2010, the
	Darwin-Wallace Medal of the Linnaean Society of London in 2009, the Miescher-Ishida Prize 
	in 1986, and a Guggenheim Fellowship in 1978.
 Margulis died at her
	home five days after suffering a stroke on 22 November 2011.
