 American Eugenics Society (1926-1972)The American Eugenics Society (AES) was established in the US by
	Madison Grant, Harry H. Laughlin, Henry Crampton, Irving Fisher, and
	Henry F. Osborn in 1926 to promote eugenics education programs for
	the US public. The AES described eugenics as the study of improving
	the genetic composition of humans through controlled reproduction of
	different races and classes of people. The AES aided smaller eugenic
	efforts such as the Galton Society in New York, New York, and the
	Race Betterment Foundation in Battle Creek, Michigan, and it influenced eugenic policy set by the US Supreme Court in cases
	including Buck v. Bell (1927) and Skinner v. Oklahoma
	(1942). The AES was renamed the Society for the Study of Social
	Biology in 1972.
Before the formation of the AES, several other eugenic
	organizations helped lead to the AES. The increasing international
	interest in eugenics from 1904 to 1926 spurred the Carnegie
	Institution of Washington in 1904 to create
	the Station for Experimental Evolution at the Cold Spring Harbor
	Laboratory in Cold Spring Harbor, New York. Geneticists Albert F. Blakeslee and
	Charles Davenport had helped establish the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory
	in 1890. Davenport, the director of the Cold Spring Harbor
	Laboratory, had connections to the Eugenics Records Office (ERO),
	and later recruited Laughlin to serve as the ERO's director.
In 1906, John H. Kellogg, a medical doctor, founded the Race
	Betterment Foundation in Battle Creek, Michigan. The Race Betterment
	Foundation sponsored three conferences between 1914 and 1928,
	culminating in the 1928 formation of a Eugenics Registry for family
	biological records. The American Museum of Natural History in New
	York, New York, financed the Galton Society. The Galton Society took
	its name after its founder Francis Galton, a UK eugenicist and
	cousin of Charles Darwin. The Galton Society focused on racial
	anthropology and was involved with the Eugenics Education Society in
	London, England, which played a major role in the 1908 foundation of
	the English Eugenics Society.
In 1912, Leonard Darwin, son of naturalist Charles Darwin, held
	the First International Congress of Eugenics in London. More than
	three hundred people from England, Europe, and the US
	attended his conference. The growing support for eugenics in the
	next decade prompted the Eugenics Record Office of Cold Spring
	Harbor and the American Museum of Natural History to sponsor the
	1921 Second International Congress of Eugenics in New York, New
	York. Scientist Alexander G. Bell served as honorary president.
	During the Second International Congress of Eugenics, Irving Fisher
	from Yale University in New Haven, Connecticut, proposed the
	American Eugenics Society. Fisher stressed a need for a widespread
	eugenics education in the US. With that proposal,
	Osborn, president of the International Congress, appointed an
	Interim Committee that worked on the AES until its formal
	incorporation on 30 January 1926. Fisher served as the society's
	first president. Davenport, director of Cold Spring Harbor
	Laboratory, was the first vice president. Among the Society's
	presidents, Laughlin, who served as president from 1927 to 1929,
	promoted eugenical sterilization in the early twentieth century
	US.
Multiple committees formed within the AES to target different
	aspects of eugenic education. Examples of such committees include
	the Committee on Crime Prevention, whose work pushed the Chicago
	Municipal Court in Chicago, Illinois, to publish Laughlin's
	Eugenical Sterilization in the United States. The credibility of the AES increased due to the involvement
	of Clark Wister, curator of the anthropology section in the American
	Museum of Natural History in New York, New York, and Sewell Wright,
	a US geneticist.
From the 1920s to the 1930s, some of the AES's work was presented
	at state and local fairs. Contests called Fitter Family contests involved popular
	competitions between families and couples to determine who would
	produce the most viable offspring based on physical appearance,
	behavior, intelligence, and health. Exhibits had flashing red lights
	to emphasize statistics of birth rates of able-bodied people
	compared to what organizers called degenerates. Statisticians
	claimed that while every sixteen seconds a child was born in the US, they also said that 
	not all children were of the same caliber. According to the exhibits,
	a capable child was born every seven and a half minutes, whereas a
	feebleminded child every 48 seconds, and a future criminal every 50
	seconds. To display potential economic benefits of adopting
	eugenics, the exhibits included the statistic that every fifteen
	seconds, one hundred dollars of taxpayer money went towards
	supporting mentally ill patients.
The goals and actions of the AES changed over the years,
	depending on different presidencies of the organization. Henry F.
	Perkins, who was president from 1931 to 1933, worked with the
	Birth Control League, the predecessor of Planned Parenthood and a US
	sexual and reproductive healthcare center. Margaret Sanger, called Noal
	Slee at the time of membership, a member of the AES in 1956,
	established the American Birth Control League in 1921. The American
	Birth Control League became part of the Planned Parenthood
	Federation of America in 1942. In the 1960s, president Harry Shapiro
	 claimed that increasing the use of birth control gave the potential
	to improve the quality of the US population.
During Perkins's presidency in 1932, the AES held the Third
	International Congress of Eugenics sponsored by the ERO and the
	American Museum of Natural History. Unlike the high attendance of
	the Second International Congress of Eugenics, seventy-three people
	attended the conference. After that conference, Perkins published A Decade in the Progress of Eugenics, and it partly
	noted that eugenics theory had no empirical support to promote
	discrimination based on race and social class. The document also
	emphasized the study of hereditary variations focusing on defects
	such as mental disability. Ellsworth Huntington from Yale
	University, who served as president of AES from 1934 to 1938,
	focused on hereditary defects and switched the AES's focus from
	positive eugenics to negative eugenics. Positive eugenics maintains
	that superior families should produce more children. In contrast,
	negative eugenics claims that degenerates should not have children.
	In his book Tomorrow's Children: The Goal of Eugenics,
	Huntington described the AES's new focus on negative eugenics.
In October of 1928, the AES launched its monthly journal
	Eugenics. At the time, Eugenics was the only journal in the
	world to promote research-based eugenics. In 1930, the Galton
	Publishing Company took over the journal, but when the company
	closed in 1931, the journal was stopped. Eight years later in 1939,
	the monthly publication of Eugenical News was transferred
	from the Eugenics Research Association to the AES. From 1916 to
	1953, Eugenical News was the primary source of
	eugenic-related events and news in the United States. In 1954, the
	AES launched Eugenics Quarterly, a journal focusing on
	hereditary defects in scientific research.
Peak membership of the AES was in 1930 with 1,260 members.
	Although New York, California, and Massachusetts were the states
	with the highest memberships, every state in the US had at least one
	member. The 1930 cohort of the AES consisted predominantly of
	wealthy men and women, and few scientific professionals from fields
	relating to eugenics. However, in reaction to the eugenic atrocities
	of World War II, support for eugenics and AES membership began to
	drop. By 1960, the AES has less than 400 members, most of whom were
	male scientists and medical professionals. After that time, the
	AES's focus shifted to genetic analysis and to the investigation of
	the factors driving human evolution.
The five Princeton conferences of 1964 to 1969 in Princeton, New
	Jersey, demonstrated a shared interest in human evolution between
	geneticists and population specialists. From 1960 to 1970, the AES
	gathered together researchers  from different disciplines and provided people with a place to
	discuss human evolution. Scientists involved with the group noted
	that factors in social and physical environments
	influence heredity and human development. Researchers
	increasingly studied living conditions and lifestyle habits of
	people.  In many large medical schools, there were facilities for
	medical genetic research, whereas newly established heredity
	counseling clinics served as the basis for modern genetic counseling
	centers. To define a new research focus, in 1969 the
	official publication of the AES switched its name from Eugenics
	Quarterly to Social Biology. In 1972, the AES was renamed
	the Society for the Study of Social Biology. The society stated that
	the name change did not align with a change in interest or policy,
	but better reflected the newfound common emphasis on the study of
	biological, social, and medical trends that shape human
	evolution.
As of 2014, the Society of Social Biology is also called the
	Society for Biodemography and Social Biology. The Society's journal,
	Biodemography and Social Biology, addresses the biological,
	social, and cultural influences on human population makeup from
	interdisciplinary fields including psychology, anthropology,
	genetics, and criminal justice. The Society of Social Biology has distanced itself from the AES.
