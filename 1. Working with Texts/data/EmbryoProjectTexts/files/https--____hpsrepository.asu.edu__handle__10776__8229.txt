 Roy John Britten (1919-2012)Roy John Britten studied DNA sequences in the US in the second
	half of the twentieth century, and he helped discover repetitive
	elements in DNA sequences. Additionally, Britten helped propose
	models and concepts of gene regulatory networks. Britten studied the
	organization of repetitive elements and, analyzing data from the
	Human Genome Project, he found that the repetitive elements in DNA
	segments do not code for proteins, enzymes, or cellular parts.
	Britten hypothesized that repetitive elements helped cause cells to
	differentiate into more specific cell kinds among different
	organisms.
Britten was born on 1 October 1919 in Washington,
	D.C., to Marion Hale, who worked for the US National Research
	Council, and Rollo Britten, a statistician at the National Bureau of
	Standards. His mother exposed Britten to science early, and he
	shared a chemistry lab in the basement with his brother. Britten
	attended the University of Virginia in Charlottesville, Virginia, in
	1936, earning his degree in physics in 1940. He then earned his
	Master's degree in physics at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore,
	Maryland, in 1941 while working on isotope separation, a process of
	removing isotopes from a chemical element to isolate other
	isotopes. 
Britten worked on the Manhattan Project until 1946. Upon
	leaving the Manhattan Project, he began his doctoral work in 1946 at
	Princeton University in Princeton, New Jersey. Britton earned his
	PhD in nuclear physics in 1951, working with a particle accelerator
	called a cyclotron. At Princeton, he met Barbara Hagen, and they
	married in 1947. They had two sons, Greg and Ken, born in 1956 and
	1958 respectively. Britten and his wife divorced in 1976, and in 1986 Britten 
	married Jacqueline Reid, who died in 2001.
 After
	taking a post-doctoral position in biophysics at the Department of
	Terrestrial Magnetism at the Carnegie Institution of Washington in
	Washington, D.C., where he stayed from 1951 to 1971, Britten took a
	course on bacteriophages at the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory in
	Cold Spring Harbor, New York, and he shifted his research to DNA
	hybridization at the Carnegie Institution. At the Carnegie
	Institution, Britten observed single stranded DNA
	segments combine to form double stranded DNA through a process
	called renaturation, or the re-pairing of complementary base pairs.
	To form the double strand, the DNA base pairs must find their
	complementary pairs. Britten hypothesized that if the strands had
	repeat sequences, it would then be easier and quicker for the base
	pairs to locate their complementary base pairs. However, if there
	was no repeat sequence, then the rate at which the base pairs form the
	double strands depended on the size of the whole genome. 
Britten, along with Michael Waring, another scientist at the Carnegie
	Institution, denatured mouse DNA in 1964. They published their
	results in a 1966 paper titled "Nucleotide Sequence Repetition: a
	Rapidly Reassociating Fraction of Mouse DNA." Britten's team had
	discovered how to isolate single copies of DNA through
	hydroxyapatite column chromatography in 1962. Utilizing
	chromatography, Britten and Waring isolated DNA of other animals and
	noted that related species have the same repeat sequences.
 Working
	with his colleague David Kohne at the Carnegie Institution in 1965,
	Britten compared the eukaryotic DNA from a mouse with the DNA of a
	single-celled bacterium. Knowing that mice had greater than one
	hundred times the amount of DNA per cell as compared to a bacterium
	Escherchia coli, they hypothesized that bacterial DNA
	would reform quicker than eukaryotic DNA. They hypothesized that as
	there was less DNA, the base pairs should find their complementary
	pairs quicker. However, they found that the eukaryotic mice DNA
	reformed double strands quicker than did the bacterial DNA, and this
	data suggested that the E. coli took longer to find its
	complementary base pairs. This work, published in the 1968 article
	"Repeated Sequences in DNA,, hinted that there were more complex
	interactions between base pairs of DNA than previously theorized.
	
Britten and Kohne tested to see how much of the mouse genome coded
	for proteins, as the majority of the mouse DNA seemed to be made of
	repetitive elements, which don't code for proteins. To test to see if mRNA
	duplicated all of the portions of the DNA, they radioactively
	labeled mRNA before dissociating the strands of the DNA to see how
	the mRNA compared with the DNA. The mRNA then combined with the DNA, but only on portions that were not repetitive, and
	Britten, noting that mRNA is a precursor to cell products, showed
	that the repetitive elements did not code for any cell product.
	Britten and Kohne confirmed that repetitive elements were large
	portions of noncoding regions of the genome in mice, calf, and
	salmon in their 1968 paper "Repeated Sequences in DNA, Hundreds of
	Thousands of Copies of DNA Sequences have been Incorporated into the
	Genomes of Higher Organisms." 
The question remained, however, as to
	why DNA that does not code for proteins would exist in genomes. Britten and
	Kohne argued that the repetitive portion of DNA most likely comes
	from errors during DNA replication. As they found many repetitive
	units near the centromere, the part of the chromosome that links
	 sister chromatids, they hypothesized that the repetitive
	portions of DNA functioned in cell division. During cell division,
	the centromere attaches to spindle fibers that allow the sister
	chromatids to be pulled apart. 
Between 1967 and 1969, Britten worked
	with Eric Davidson at the California Institute of Technology
	(CalTech) to propose a gene regulation network model, in which genes
	interacted to control cell differentiation through expression of
	genes. They sought to predict the development of different organisms
	by following the regulatory genes that controlled specific genes
	that were turned on at specific times. At the time, embryologists could not distinguish what
	processes controlled cell differentiation and cell determination. Britten and
	Davidson connected regulatory RNAs to repetitive sequences in their
	model, showing that RNA could interact and regulate DNA. However,
	the method in which the RNAs functioned in gene expression was not
	clearly outlined. Since the introduction of the Britten-Davidson
	model, researchers have used it to model the functioning of genes in
	many animals. They published their theory in 1969, in an article
	titled "Gene Regulation for Higher Cells: A Theory." 
Through the
	1970s, Britten developed methods for identifying genetic
	similarities between organisms. In 1971, Britten took a visiting
	associate professorship at the Kerckhoff Marine Lab, a part of
	CalTech, in Newport Beach, California. Davidson joined Britten at
	CalTech to work on The Macroproject during the same year. Funded by
	the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development
	headquartered at Bethesda, Maryland, Britten and Davidson developed
	The Macroproject to examine how genes affected organisms as they developed. Britten
	and Davidson used the sea urchin embryo as their model system. In
	1971, Britten and Davidson published "Repetitive and Non Repetitive
	DNA Sequences and a Speculation on the Origins of Evolutionary
	Novelty," in which they concluded that legs and fins develop as a
	direct result of specific genes turned on during specific times of
	development. 
After this work, Britten and Davidson partnered to
	study the regulation of gene in animal development until Britten's
	death in 2012. To study how repetitive DNA sequences were distributed
	throughout the sea urchin genome, Britten and Davidson in the early 1970s sheared DNA at different lengths and then reattached the
	sheared base pairs (re-natured) to their complementary pairs. They discovered that large
	portions of the sea urchins' genomes contained repetitive elements
	that interspersed among smaller coding regions. In 1971, they found
	that mammalian and frog DNA also had large portions of repetitive
	elements. However, the repetitive elements differed in composition
	between different species, and even between closely related species.
	
Britten was promoted to senior research associate at CalTech in 1973. While
	teaching a class in the summer of 1973, Britten used his students to
	help sequence the DNA of multiple marine organisms. Using the
	sequenced data, he showed that genomes were organized in many
	different ways, and that the ranges for repetitive units varied
	extensively across species. He showed that the fruit fly, for
	instance, had no repetitive units.  In the 1980s, Britten studied
	messenger RNA in embryos, culminating in the 1980 publication
	"Messenger RNA Prevalence in Sea Urchin Embryos Measured with Cloned
	cDNAs." Britten discovered that different genes were expressed at
	different intervals in the sea urchin embryo as it developed, and he showed how to
	measure the rates of synthesis of nuclear RNA and the corresponding
	mRNA levels in the cytoplasm of the cells.
 Beginning in 1990,
	Britten focused on genomics and evolution. With computational
	analyses, Britten used data generated by the Human Genome Project to
	determine how repetitive elements affected the human genome. Britten
	studied repetitive DNA and how it influenced evolutionary
	history. At first, Britten only accounted for substitutions, in which a single base pair in a DNA sequence replaces, over the course of evolution, a different base
	pair in that sequence. Later Britten started observing indels, or whole sections of
	DNA that were removed or added to DNA sequences over the course of evolution. He published this research in
	2002. He found that 1.4 percent of
	differences between chimpanzee and human DNA were caused by
	substitution, while 3.9 percent were caused by indels. This paper
	challenged the 1975 theory proposed by Alan Wilison and Mary-Claire
	King, working at the University of California Berkeley in Berkeley,
	California, that chimps and humans shared greater than 98 percent
	of their DNA. In addition to primates, Britten also used sea urchins
	to look for similar patterns in the genomes caused by the repetitive
	DNA elements. 
	
Beyond his work in science, Britten sailed, played the
	flute, and painted. In 1972, he was elected into the US National
	Academy of Sciences in Washington, D.C. Britten studied primate genomes at
	CalTech until his death on 21 January 2012, of pancreatic cancer.
