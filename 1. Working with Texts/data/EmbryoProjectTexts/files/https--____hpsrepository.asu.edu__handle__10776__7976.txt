 Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory (1890- )Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory (CSHL) is a non-profit
	research institution that specializes in cancer, neuroscience, plant
	biology, quantitative biology, and genomics. The organization is
	located on the shores of Cold Spring Harbor in Laurel Hollow, New
	York. The Brooklyn Institute of Arts and Sciences established the
	CSHL in 1890, to provide scientists with facilities to research
	Charles Darwin's evolutionary theory. The first mission of CSHL was
	biological science education. Since 1998, CSHL has housed the Watson
	School of Biological Sciences, a PhD program dedicated to scientific
	research. Nobel Laureates who conducted experiments at the CSHL
	include Barbara McClintock, Alfred Hershey, James Watson, Francis
	Crick, and Sydney Brenner. Throughout its history, researchers at
	CSHL have studied embryology, reproductive medicine, and
	genetics.
In 1889, John D. Jones donated eight acres of land and buildings
	he owned on the south shore of Cold Spring Harbor, formerly a part
	of the Cold Spring Harbor Whaling Company, to the Brooklyn Institute
	of Arts and Sciences to build CSHL. Jones was the son of John H.
	Jones, managing agent of the Cold Spring Harbor Whaling Company.
	The CSHL's proximal location to the seashore provided its researchers a
	wealth of plants and animals to study. The CSHL offered its first
	course on biology on 7 July 1890 as an extension of the Brooklyn
	Institute of Arts and Sciences. In 1898, Charles Davenport,
	professor of evolutionary biology at Harvard University, in
	Cambridge, Massachusetts, became the first director of CSHL.
In 1902, philanthropist Andrew Carnegie founded the Carnegie
	Institute in Washington, D.C., as an organization to fund and support
	 exceptional scientific discovery. Davenport requested the
	Carnegie Institute of Washington to start a genetics research
	program within CSHL. Davenport's request was granted in June 1904
	with the establishment of the Station for Experimental Evolution in
	Washington, D.C., later renamed the Carnegie Institution Department of
	Genetics in 1921. Hugo de Vries, who proposed the concept of gene,
	presented a commemorative speech at the Station's opening.
In 1910, Davenport founded the Eugenics Record Office (ERO) at
	CSHL, which encouraged eugenics research. Eugenics is a theory
	that holds that controlled reproduction can change a population's genetics, and that human reproduction should be controlled to some extent. Davenport approached Harry H. Laughlin, a fellow eugenicist, to be
	superintendent in 1910. From 1910 to 1921, Laughlin served alongside
	Davenport as superintendent, and from 1921 to 1939, as Davenport's
	assistant director. The two established the Eugenics Research
	Association at CSHL in 1913. Davenport and Laughlin described the
	Eugenics Research Association as an organization dedicated to
	promoting a eugenic agenda based on scientific research. For
	example, in 1927, the Eugenics Research Association began to study
	the ancestry of United States senators. Laughlin was
	secretary-treasurer of the Eugenics Research Association after 1917.
	Eugenical News, a journal dedicated to the public promotion
	of eugenics through anti-immigration and racist propaganda, was the
	first publication of the Eugenics Research Office in 1916.
Every summer until its closing in 1939, researchers met at the
	Eugenics Research Office at CSHL to learn how to conduct eugenics
	research, such as doing interviews, compiling medical histories, and
	forming human pedigrees. The ERO's Record of Family Traits and
	Family Tree Folder organized the genealogies of families with
	medical conditions based mostly on voluntary surveys. Davenport's
	work with an albino family led to the first genetics-based study of
	albinism, a disorder that causes the complete or partial spotting of
	skin, eyes, or hair color due to a defect in melanin, which is
	usually responsible for pigmentation in organisms. Results of
	Davenport's study were published in the 1916 article "Heredity of
	Albinism."
In June 1920, Laughlin cited eugenics research conducted at the
	ERO when he served as an expert agent for the Committee on
	Immigration and Naturalization in the US House of Representatives.
	Laughlin's testimony culminated in the passage of the Immigration
	Restriction Act of 1924, an act that reduced United States
	immigration to one-fifth of what was previously allowed.
In 1924, Davenport appointed his son-in-law, Reginald Harris, to
	be director of the Biological Laboratory at CSHL, which expanded
	CSHL's research focuses from eugenics to broader biological
	issues. Harris had previously studied at CSHL in 1916 as an
	undergraduate, and he then worked the Cornell Entomological
	Expedition to South America with James C. Bradley from 1919 to 1920, during which
	 he studied insects in South America.
	In 1933, Harris changed the focus of the Biological Laboratory to
	research quantitative biology with an emphasis on physiology and
	biophysics, and he created the Cold Spring Harbor Symposium on
	Quantitative Biology.
The declining support for the US eugenics movement around World
	War II caused the ERO to close in 1939. Geneticist Milislav
	Demerec became director of the CSHL in 1941. Demerec researched
	bacteria and the viruses that infect bacteria called bacteriophages.
	Through his research of bacterial genetics at CSHL, Demerec
	increased the yield of the antibiotic penicillin during World War II
	by isolating mutants of the fungus Penicillium
	chrysogenum.
In 1945, Max Delbrück, who had inspired Demerec to research
	bacterial genetics, taught the first advanced course at the CSHL,
	called the Phage Course. Because Delbrück was a biophysicist, he
	focused on quantitative biology and biological research that
	intersected with engineering, biochemistry, and physics. The Phage
	Course influenced molecular genetics because it
	taught students to ascertain the physical properties of the
	gene. Delbrück taught the Phage Course until 1970. During that time,
	he introduced students to basic bacteriophage
	research methods and procedures. Graduates of the Phage Course
	include molecular biologists Seymour Benzer, Franklin Stahl, and
	John Cairns. For his students' graduations from the Phage Course,
	Delbrück organized parties, which included games inspired by genetic
	principles.  For example, a game inspired by recombination, the
	process by which DNA is broken and synthesized, included
	two people going into a closet and exchanging articles of clothing.
	The new outfits that were created represented the new phenotypes, or
	outward expressions of the genetic makeup of an organism (genotype)
	that resulted from recombination.
Some students of the Phage Course became
	members of the Phage Group, a society headed by Delbrück and focused
	on bacteriophage research. Members of the Phage Group included
	microbiologist Salvador Luria and molecular geneticist Alfred
	Hershey. Luria collaborated with Delbrück in teaching the Phage
	Course and in the Phage Group leadership. Luria and
	Delbrück conducted experiments together, one of which which became called the
	Luria-Delbrück experiment in 1943. The Luria-Delbrück experiment
	showed that genetic mutations in bacteria could occur at random. In
	1969, Delbrück and Luria, along with Hershey, received the Nobel
	Prize in Physiology or Medicine for their work on the viral genetic
	structure and replication mechanisms of bacteria.
In 1941, Demerec invited Barbara McClintock, who studied
	chromosome behavior and structure, to CSHL. In 1942,
	McClintock became a full-time researcher, and she later said that
	she enjoyed the freedom that CSHL gave her because she did not have
	to teach or consistently apply for external funding. CSHL provided
	McClintock land to grow maize for her experiments. Evelyn Fox
	Keller, a biographer of McClintock, said that at the CSHL, McClintock was
	not subject to as much discrimination as women scientists
	elsewhere because of her full-time position. In 1944 at CSHL,
	McClintock began working on the research that led her to discover transposable elements or transposons, DNA sequences
	capable of moving locations within an organism's chromosomes.
	The National Academy of Sciences, a society in the US that advises
	the federal government in science, medicine, and engineering,
	elected McClintock to the organization in 1944. McClintock worked at
	CSHL until her retirement in 1967, but she stayed involved as a
	scientist emerita. In 1983, she received the Nobel Prize in
	Physiology or Medicine for her lifetime research on transposons.
Alfred Hershey joined the Genetics Research Unit at CSHL in 1950,
	and he worked in the Animal House, later renamed the McClintock
	Laboratory. In 1952, Hershey and his laboratory assistant Martha
	Chase conducted the Waring Blender experiment. The Waring Blender
	experiment used bacteriophage proteins and the bacteria Escherichia coli
	to show that genes are composed of DNA, not of proteins. Hershey
	directed the Genetics Research Unit at CSHL from 1962 until retiring
	in 1974. Chase left CSHL in 1953, but returned each summer during
	the 1950s to attend the Phage Group meetings.
James Watson, who described the double-helix structure of DNA
	alongside with Francis Crick in 1953, participated at CSHL throughout
	his career. Watson first publicly
	described the double helix structure of DNA at the 1953 Cold Spring
	Harbor Symposium titled "Viruses," and he stayed active in CSHL for the
	rest of his career. In 1948, Watson was a graduate student in
	Luria's laboratory at Indiana University in Bloomington, Indiana,
	where he met Delbrück.
In November 1953, biologist and geneticist Sydney Brenner asked
	then-director Demerec to work at the CSHL. Demerec approved, and in July
	1954, after working in South Africa, Brenner arrived in the United
	States and spent his first two and a half months at the CSHL. During
	that time, Brenner took bacteriophage and bacterial genetics courses
	while researching the amino acid tryptophan. While at CSHL, Brenner
	networked with molecular geneticists like Delbrück, Luria, and
	behavioral geneticist Seymour Benzer. Brenner helped establish C. elegans as a
	model organism for research in developmental biology, because researchers could conveniently reproduce these organisms in large
	quantities for many generations. Additionally, Brenner helped to
	show that amino acid sequences in the genetic code must be read in
	order (non-overlapping), which led Crick to posit the existence of
	an RNA molecule, later called transfer RNA (tRNA), that links DNA and messenger RNA to amino acids. In 2002, Brenner received the Nobel Prize
	in Physiology or Medicine with Howard Robert Horvitz and John
	Sulston for their discoveries on genetic regulation.
By 1962, the Carnegie Institute of Washington no longer supported
	the Department of Genetics, so the Department of Genetics joined
	with the Biological Laboratory to create the Cold Spring Harbor
	Laboratory of Quantitative Biology. In 1970, the name was shortened
	to Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory because research projects were
	beginning to encompass more than just quantitative biology. Due to
	the lack of funding from the Carnegie Institute of Washington, CSHL
	struggled with funds, but director John Cairns handled the CSHL's
	finances. Cairns served as director from 1963 until he resigned
	to return to research at CSHL in 1968.
While a professor at Harvard, Watson became director of the CSHL
	in 1968. Watson focused on cancer research, hiring virologist Joe
	Sambrook in 1969 to establish the Tumor Virus Group at CSHL. The
	Tumor Virus Group defined and mapped major genes of
	viruses that commonly use humans as hosts (adenoviruses) and the
	major genes of a DNA virus that sometimes causes tumors (SV40).
In 1973, philanthropist and investment banker Charles S.
	Robertson endowed CSHL with eight million dollars in the form of the
	Robertson Research Fund, bringing monetary support to CSHL.
	Robertson also donated his Banbury Estate in Lloyd Harbor, part of Long
	Island, New York. In 1977  the estate became the Banbury Conference Center.
As a privately funded research institution, CSHL chooses its
	research projects relating to cancer, neuroscience, plant biology,
	quantitative biology, bioinformatics, and genomics. CSHL is one of
	about sixty institutions endorsed by the Cancer Centers Program of
	the National Cancer Institute in Rockville, Maryland. The Arnold and Mabel Beckman Laboratory, established in 1990,
	pursues neuroscience research. Plant biology research at CSHL
	focuses on developmental plant genetics that affect crop
	productivity, climate change, and biodiversity. Biological plant
	research expanded during the 1980s with the building of the Page
	Laboratory. The Simons Center for Quantitative Biology applies
	mathematics, engineering, computer science, and theoretical physics
	to CSHL's genomic analysis and image processing.
From maize to mice, scientists researched cancer at CSHL.  The
	1916 discovery of the susceptibility of Japanese waltzing mice
	(Mus musculus molossinus) to transplanted connective tissue
	cancers (sarcomas) by Clarence Little at CSHL led E. Carleton
	MacDowell to develop mice with heightened vulnerability or
	resistance to cancer. 1980s cancer research focused on genes that
	stimulate the cell cycle (oncogenes), yeast genetics, and the
	control of the cell cycle and growth. In 1987, the US National Cancer Institute (NCI), headquartered in Bethesda, Maryland, awarded the CSHL
	with a grant, which shifted its focus on DNA tumor viruses.  
In 1988, one of the first CSHL
	fellows, Carol Greider, conducted research on telomeres, the end
	sequences of DNA that protects chromosomes during cell division.
	Greider received the 2009 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine with
	Elizabeth Blackburn and Jack Szostak for showing how the enzyme
	telomerase works in conjunction with telomeres to protect chromosomes within a cell.
Educational programs expanded under Watson's term as director.
	The DNA Learning Center became an early organization dedicated
	to providing accessible information to the public about genetics.
	Bruce Stillman had worked at the CSHL in the 1970s and 1980s, researching DNA
	replication. CSHL instituted postgraduate courses, including the
	 Yeast Genetics course, in addition to 
	the DNA Learning Center in 1988. Watson became president of CSHL
	when Stillman became director in 1994. In 1998, CSHL became a
	PhD-awarding establishment with the launch of the Watson School of
	Biological Sciences.  Stillman became president of CSHL in 2003 when Watson
	became chancellor. In 2007, Watson retired from his position.
	CSHL's largest expansion came in the form of the Hillside
	Laboratories, established in 2009. The Hillside Laboratories increased research space by
	forty percent, allowing two hundred research personnel to work
	throughout the six buildings.
Genomics research for the CSHL is based at the Woodbury Genome
	Center in Woodbury, New York, a few miles away from CSHL. In November
	2013, CSHL began construction on a fifteen million dollar drug
	testing facility.  Researchers there work on drugs to
	treat pancreatic, lung, liver, prostate, and breast cancer, along
	with leukemia and melanoma.
Aside from its research agenda, CSHL focuses on communication.
	Annual meetings are held at the Long Island location as well as the
	Cold Spring Harbor Asia Conference in Suzhou, China. The Banbury
	Center holds meetings for scientists and global specialists to
	discuss policy surrounding molecular genetics and biology,
	neuroscience, human genetics, and scientific innovations. The CSHL
	Press publishes papers and journals such as Genome Research
	and Genes and Development.
As of 2014, Bruce Stillman is
	the chief executive officer and president of the CSHL.
