 Walter Stanborough Sutton (1877-1916)Walter Stanborough Sutton studied grasshoppers and connected
the phenomena of meiosis, segregation, and independent assortment with
the chromosomal theory of inheritance in the early twentieth century in
the US. Sutton researched chromosomes, then called inheritance
mechanisms. He confirmed a theory of Wilhelm Roux, who studied embryos
in Breslau, Germany, in the late 1880s, who had argued that chromosomes and
heredity were linked. Theodor Boveri, working in Munich, Germany,
independently reached similar conclusions about heredity as Sutton.
Later scientists named the theory The Sutton-Boveri Theory, or The
chromosomal theory of inheritance.
Sutton, the fifth of seven brothers,
was born in Utica, New York, on 5 April 1877 to Agnes Black and William
Bell Sutton, who soon moved their family to Kansas. Sutton grew up on a farm, where he repaired farm equipment
and attended schools in Russell County, Kansas. In 1896, he
entered the engineering school at the University of Kansas in Lawrence,
Kansas. While Sutton's brother was sick in 1897 of typhoid fever, Sutton
took care of him and his other infected family members. His family and
friends convinced him to change his educational direction to medicine,
because he was, according to his family, so adept at caring for them.
 In
the fall of 1897, Sutton started his pre-medical studies. Sutton
completed his undergraduate degree in 1900. A year later he received a master's degree, also at the
University of Kansas with the mentoring of Clarence McClung.
For his master's thesis in 1901, Sutton published the first of his
works, "The Spermatogonial Division of Brachystola magna" about
chromosomes in B. magna, a type of grasshopper. The testes of these
grasshoppers were large enough for Sutton to observe meiotic divisions
of the chromosomes, which allowed Sutton to describe what was
occurring in the cells.
 Instead of applying to medical school, McClung
convinced Sutton to do doctoral work at Columbia University in New York,
New York. Sutton traveled to Colombia to work with cell biologist Edmund
Beecher Wilson in the fall of 1901. Wilson had previously observed
X-linked inheritance, or traits that offspring seemingly inherited from
their parents' X-chromosomes. Sutton continued to research B. magna,
eventually encapsulating his chromosome theory in two papers he
published titled "Morphology of the Chromosome Group in Brachystola
magna" in 1902 and "The Chromosomes in Heredity" in 1903.
Sutton's 1902 paper examined sperm production, cell division,
and synapsis in B. magna. In this paper, he described a cellular basis
for genetics. First, somatic cells contain one of each of the parents'
chromosomes. The offspring receive one chromosome from each of the
parents to make a set of chromosomes. Sutton's theory differed from
other contemporary theories in that Sutton argued that the offspring
received a random group of traits after the parents' traits mixed
together in the paired chromosomes of the offspring. For Sutton, the individual
chromosomes retained their integrity when passed from the parents to the
offspring, that is each chromosome remains together as a whole. 
Sutton's
second point in the paper argued that somatic cells have pairs of
chromosomes. Sutton's third point was that each chromosome codes for a
specific set of traits. Further, a fourth point was that chromosomes
are predetermined in what traits they code for. Fifth, chromosomes
separate independently of each other, which means that each part of the
chromosome will remain separate from a different set of genes on a
different chromosome. The chromosomes migrate to different poles of
cells when they pull apart from each other, which enables many different
combinations of the genes that can occur in offspring. Finally,
chromosomes can code for different forms of a trait, but only one will
be expressed as a physical characteristic. The different forms of a
trait will either be dominant or recessive. The sixth point supports Mendel's theory that one parent's trait will be expressed in an offspring while the other's will be
hidden.
 Sutton makes
four points in the 1903 paper. The first is that each chromosome in a
cell is different from the others in composition. Second, chromosomes
come in pairs. Both halves of a chromosomes pair are the same size, and
each half is derived from one of the organism's parents. Third, the
chromosomes, which are located in the nucleus, pair up before meiotic
divisions. Finally, the paired chromosomes separate in meiosis. While not widely read at the time, later scientists cited the paper as
central in chromosomal research.
 Sutton argued that chromosomes are the
mechanism of how traits are passed on from parents to offspring.
Furthermore, he supported Gregor Mendel's 1865 theory of independent
assortment and segregation of hereditary factors. Sutton argued that
each parent passes on a half set of chromosomes to their offspring.
Sutton's theories explained  the variance in and the combinations of
traits in Mendel's works. 
 Another scientist, Theodor Boveri,
independently from Sutton developed similar theories about the role of
chromosomes in heredity while working with sea urchins in Germany in
1900. Scientists credit both Sutton and Boveri with the theory of
inheritance, also called the Sutton-Boveri Theory. Though
many contemporaries did not agree with Sutton and Boveri, later work by
Eleanor Carothers at Pennsylvania State University in University Park,
Pennsylvania, helped support the law of independent assortment of
chromosomes from parents to offspring and in crossing over in homologous
chromosomes in the parents.
 In the summer of 1903, Sutton stopped
studying developmental biology to work in the Kansas oil fields to earn
money for medical school. In 1905, he returned to Columbia to attend
medical school. Sutton received his MD degree in 1907 and began an
internship at Roosevelt Hospital in New York, New York. After two years,
he began practicing medicine in Kansas City. From 1907 to 1915, Sutton
became associate professor of Surgery at University of Kansas
with an affiliation at Bell Memorial Hospital. While at Bell Memorial
Hosptial, Sutton developed the technique of using ether as anesthesia
during surgery. 
In 1915, the military hired Sutton as part of the
surgical staff for the Mrs. Harry Paine Whitney Unit during World War I.
He became to the chief of the surgical staff by the end of his tour. On
6 November 1916, his appendix ruptured while he was in the US, and four days later he
died at the age of thirty nine. In 1917, Sutton's family released a
biography that many of his colleagues, friends, and family put together,
called Walter Stanborough Sutton, which included several essays about
Sutton's life and work.
