 Kass v. Kass (1998)Court: New York Court of Appeals
		Citation: Kass v. Kass, 696 N.E.2d 174 (N.Y. 1998)
		Status as current law: Probable
		Value as precedent: Low
Case significance:
In a case of first impression in the state of New York, the highest state court decided that a prior written agreement between progenitors of 
		frozen embryos regarding the disposition of their “pre-zygotes” in the event of divorce is binding. By copying the general result arrived at by the Tennessee Supreme Court in Davis v. Davis in 1992, the New York court magnified the weight of authority in favor of upholding prior written agreements for 
		in vitro fertilization practices.
Case Summary:
Facts—Mr. and Mrs. Kass entered into a contract for 
				IVF and cryopreservation of embryos that provided in the event of a divorce, the frozen embryos would be donated to the IVF clinic for research. During the lengthy 
				IVF process, Mrs. Kass 
				miscarried once and suffered an 
				ectopic pregnancy once. After a failed attempt to implant four 
				frozen embryos in Mrs. Kass’ sister as 
				surrogate, the couple divorced. Mrs. Kass won custody of the remaining five 
				frozen embryos in the trial court.
Law—Basic contract law prevailed. The 
				frozen embryos were not 
				persons.
Ruling—The Court of Appeals held that: (1) agreements between progenitors, or gamete donors, regarding disposition of their pre-zygotes should generally be presumed valid and binding, and enforced in any dispute between them, and (2) the informed consents signed by the parties before cryopreservation required that the custody dispute be resolved by donating the pre-zygotes to the 
				IVF program for research.
Quotes:
“Supreme Court granted appellant custody of the pre-zygotes and directed her to exercise her right to implant them within a medically reasonable time. The court reasoned that a female participant in the 
			IVF procedure has exclusive decisional authority over the fertilized eggs created through that process, just as a pregnant woman has exclusive decisional authority over a nonviable fetus, and that appellant had not waived her right either in the May 12, 1993 consents or in the June 7, 1993 ‘uncontested divorce’ agreement.”
“While a divided Appellate Division reversed that decision, all five Justices unanimously agreed on two fundamental propositions. First, they concluded that a woman's right to privacy and bodily integrity are not implicated before implantation occurs. Second, the court unanimously recognized that when parties to an 
			IVF procedure have themselves determined the disposition of any unused fertilized eggs, their agreement should control.”
“Like the Appellate Division, we conclude that disposition of these pre-zygotes does not implicate a woman's right of privacy or bodily integrity in the area of reproductive choice; nor are the pre-zygotes recognized as ‘persons’ for constitutional purposes. The relevant inquiry thus becomes who has dispositional authority over them. Because that question is answered in this case by the parties’ agreement, for purposes of resolving the present appeal we have no cause to decide whether the pre-zygotes are entitled to special respect.”
