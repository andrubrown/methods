 Victor Jollos
(1887-1941)Victor Jollos studied fruit flies and microorganisms in
	Europe and the US, and he introduced the concept of
	Dauermodifikationen in the early 1900s. The concept of
	Dauermodifikationen refers to environmentally-induced traits
	that are heritable for only a limited number of generations. Some
	scientists interpreted the results of Jollos's work on Paramecium and
	Drosophila
	as evidence for cytoplasmic inheritance. Jollos was forced to
	emigrate from Germany to the United States due to anti-semitic
	government policies in the early 1930s. Nevertheless, his work on
	Dauermodifikationen remained central to theoretical discourse
	among German zoologists concerning heredity, development, and
	evolution. Jollos was born on 12 August 1887 in Odessa,
	Ukraine, then a part of Russia. Jollos's parents, Rosa Jurowsky and
	Gregor Jollos, emigrated to Germany while he was young, and Jollos
	attended high-school in Heidelberg and Berlin. As an undergraduate
	at the University of Berlin, Jollos studied with zoologist Max
	Hartmann, who studied reproduction in unicellular organisms. 
Jollos also studied with experimental embryologist and
	protozoologist Richard von Hertwig at the University of Munich in
	Munich, Germany, where Jollos received his PhD in zoology in 1910. 
	Jollos pursued protozoology, the study of single-celled eukaryotic
	organisms called protists, after the first taxonomic system for
	classifying Protozoa was constructed. Jollos's graduate mentor,
	Hertwig, founded on of the first German protozoological research
	institutes in Munich in 1885. While Jollos was a student,
	protozoologists began to publish in their own journals and train new
	researchers specifically in the field of protozoology.
	Protozoologists, including Hertwig, preferred to study the large
	freshwater protist Paramecium. Paramecium became
	Jollos's experimental organism of choice for the next two decades.
	 From 1912 to 1914 Jollos worked as a research assistant at
	the Robert Koch Institute (RKI), previously called the Prussian
	Institute for Infectious Diseases, in Berlin. During this time
	Jollos reported his first observations of Dauermodifikationen
	in Paramecium. Jollos used a technique called the pure line
	experimental technique to study heredity in Paramecium.
	Wilhelm Ludvig Johannsen in Denmark had developed the pure line
	method for use in plants in the early 1900s, and microbiologist
	Herbert Spencer Jennings in the US had adapted the method for use
	with microorganisms in the 1910s.  For his studies, Jollos
	induced asexual or parthenogenetic reproduction in Paramecium
	to produce lineages of genetically identical individuals. After
	exposing Paramecium from those lineages to an environmental
	stressor, such as high levels of toxins or extreme heat, Jollos
	found that the Paramecium exhibited new characteristics, such
	as resistance to specific toxins, that persisted in the offspring
	for hundreds of generations, even after Jollos removed the stressor
	from the environments of those lineages. Jollos called those
	modifications Dauermodifikationen, or permanent
	modifications. Although Jollos critiqued theories of
	cytoplasmic inheritance, some embryologists saw Jollos's
	Dauermodifikationen  as evidence that the cytoplasm of
	germinal cells function in heredity. During this period, biologists
	debated whether the nucleus or the cytoplasm of germ cells was
	primarily responsible for transmitting characteristics from parents
	to their offspring. Geneticists, who largely accepted Gregor
	Mendel's recently rediscovered principles of heredity, said that the
	nuclei of germ cells contained hereditary material and produced
	heritable characteristics in organisms as those organisms developed.
	Many embryologists resisted these claims, however, and maintained
	that the cytoplasm, not the nucleus, of the germ cell was primarily
	responsible for heredity, either by controlling the action of
	nuclear genes or by containing hereditary factors themselves.
	Plasmon theorists, who claimed that the traits characteristic of
	taxonomic groups above the rank of species—groups such as
	genera, classes, and orders—are rooted in cytoplasmic factors
	rather than nuclear genes, also claimed Dauermodifikationen
	as evidence of cytoplasmic inheritance. With the onset of
	World War I in 1914, Jollos left his newly-acquired post as acting
	director of the protozoology department at RKI to pursue medical
	qualifications for the war effort. Jollos studied medicine at the
	University of Berlin, and he passed his Medizinisches
	Staatsexamen (state medical exams) in 1918. When the war ended,
	Jollos resumed his experimental work as a research assistant at the
	Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Biology (KWI), in the Dahlem district
	of Berlin, where he remained until 1925. In 1920 Jollos married
	pianist Ilse Raven, with whom he later had two daughters, Eva and
	Inge. From 1921 to 1925 Jollos also held the position of
	privatdozent (private lecturer), a pre-tenure position, at
	the University of Berlin. In 1925 Jollos relocated to Cairo,
	Egypt, upon the invitation of the Egyptian Government. As a
	professor at the Egyptian University in Cairo, Jollos organized the
	new zoology department. Meanwhile, Jollos became special adviser to
	the Egyptian Ministry of Agriculture in Cairo, concerning sheep and
	poultry breeding experiments. Jollos also served as president of the
	Royal Zoological Society of Egypt in Cairo, and he sat on the board
	of examiners for medical and veterinary schools in Cairo. In 1929
	Jollos returned to the KWI in Berlin, where he oversaw a research
	laboratory in Max Hartmann's Department for Protistology. Jollos was
	also reinstated at the University of Berlin, where he became an
	associate professor of zoology.  Jollos saw his experimental
	work as a contribution to the theory of orthogenetic evolution.
	Wilhelm Haacke, director of the Natural History Museum in Adelaide,
	Australia, coined the term orthogenesis in his 1883 book
	Gestaltung und Vererbung (Design and Inheritance). Zoologist
	Theodor Eimer in Tübingen, Germany, further articulated and
	promoted the theory of orthogenesis in his 1888 book  Die
	Entstehung der Arten auf Grund von Vererben erworbener Eigenschaften
	nach den Gesetzen organischen Waschsens  (Organic Evolution as
	the Result of the Inheritance of Acquired Characters According to
	the Laws of Organic Growth). Haacke and Eimer said that natural
	selection acting on random mutations couldn't explain patterns of
	directional change in the fossil record, such as the sequential
	reduction of limbs in the evolution of snakes. Orthogenesists
	claimed that such directional change involved either an external
	directive force, or constraints internal to the organism that
	determined specific directions in which a species could evolve.
	Jollos theorized that one source of directionality in evolution was
	directed mutation, the claim that environmental factors, such as
	high temperature, could elicit specific and predictable heritable
	mutations. After returning to Berlin in 1929, Jollos read a
	report on a new method for producing mutations in fruit flies (Drosophila
	melanogaster) published by geneticist Richard Goldschmidt,
	who was also affiliated with the KWI. Over the next five years
	Jollos used Goldschmidt's method, which involved exposing
	Drosophila larvae to high temperatures at a key point in
	their development. That method enabled Jollos to investigate the
	capacity of environmental factors to produce directional mutations
	in Drosophila for eye color. In the course of those
	experiments, Jollos generated mutations in what he claimed were
	orthogenetic series. For example, when Jollos exposed larval flies
	to high temperatures, those flies developed into adults with light
	colored eyes, a phenomenon that intensified when he applied the same
	technique to the flies' offspring. Jollos interpreted these results
	to corroborate orthogenetic theory, and he thought them consistent
	with observations from paleontologists, who said that periods of
	climatic warming correlated with high frequencies of speciation.
Although Jollos was raised as a Protestant, he had Jewish
	ancestry, and he fell victim to antisemitic policies that took
	effect with the installation of Adolf Hitler as chancellor of the
	Third Reich in 1933. Jollos was expelled from his post at the KWI in
	autumn of that year. Unable to acquire a job in Germany, Jollos and
	his family emigrated to the UK, where he worked in Francis A. E.
	Crew's animal breeding lab at the University of Edinburgh in
	Edinburgh, Scotland, in early 1934. In late 1934 Jollos accepted a
	fellowship from the Institute of International Education,
	headquartered in New York, New York, via the Emergency Committee in
	Aid of Displaced German Scholars, as well as an offer of research
	facilities at the University of Wisconsin in Madison, Wisconsin.
Jollos lacked incubators for his heat induction experiments for
	the first six months of his time at the University of Wisconsin.
	Even with the incubators, Jollos struggled to continue his research
	given his financial woes. When Jollos's fellowship from the
	Emergency Committee ended in summer of 1935, he obtained no academic
	employment, despite the efforts of Goldschmidt and fellow
	protozoologist Tracy Morton Sonneborn. Jollos and his family were
	supported financially by temporary funding from the National
	Coordinating Committee for Aid to Refugees and Emigrants Coming from
	Germany, honoraria from guest lectures, and a few friends at the
	university. Jollos's lack of research funding prevented him from
	continuing the heat induction experiments. With the help of
	colleagues, Jollos secured limited funding from the National
	Research Council's Committee on Radiation, headquartered in
	Washington, D.C., to investigate the mutagenic effects of cosmic
	radiation in Drosophila. In autumn of 1937 the University of
	Wisconsin rescinded Jollos's access to laboratory facilities. That
	year, Jollos suffered two heart attacks. Already suffering from
	diabetes, his health deteriorated rapidly. In 1937 Jollos completed
	a lecture tour in the eastern US, visiting Yale Univerity, Johns
	Hopkins University, the University of Rochester, and Amerherst
	University. Jollos died on 5 July 1941, at the age of 54, leaving
	his family in poverty.
